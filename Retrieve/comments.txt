In other words another billionaire is pissed that he is losing to a bunch of us uneducated traders They are probably worried that theyll lose customers who realize they can manage their own 401k or Roth
Ask me how little I give a fuck when old billionaires try to advise me what they think is in my best interest
“Angry billionaire tells peasant traders to get off his lawn”FTFY
So is he trying to get people to sell their shares or whatPretty sure these guys weren’t saying shit in January while they were jumping out due to the Ron

The truth is that the market is not what it used to be recessions and depressions are a thing of the past robinhood investors together with their unhinged swing trading flip the markets everyday with a raging bull sentiment straight up and it is sustained by the fed which only means the stock market will never fail even if the economy is in shambles god bless america and the stock market
He doesn’t realize half the time we don’t even know what we just bought if printer goes brrrrr from it we could give less of a fuq
He had his time and reacts jealous to the succes of others Pretty weak

Diamond hands is a meme created by theta gang to help you lose moneyI feel personally attacked dont you kill something so beneficial to my portfolio
Gather round youngunsThis here is a ton of wisdom from a grizzled veteran whos been around since early 2020
Be retarded in the daily thread not in your portfoliogot it
Yolo that 16k and 10x it
Lost 37k from his peak and is giving advice Full WSB
I saw someone on wsb say something like just harvest 2050 gains all day and it changed everything I was doing up to that pointTrying to hit rich quick is dumb luck and the outcomes reflect the odds pretty consistentlyExit plans both ways
Buy 30 days out or 12 weeks ahead of earnings and cash in on the inevitable IV explosion just get out before it implodes againTarget 1020 OTM FDs rarely payout on this
Failed 3 this morning with my SPY puts watched the page tell me I was up 77 — and I didn’t close ‘em out Like what the hell was I thinking
Ill post some jems here that I guarantee 90 you squares have ever seen before and will put you on some fucken real game Soon
I appreciate this
I feel like Delta is super important It’s the first Greek I look at I don’t think that makes me a nerd Rho is for the nerds
To piggy back on 1 Your winning trades should pay for at least three losersLosers with few exceptions should be dropped at 2030Winners should be 100 and upPsychologically this is hard to stick toAnd is also the reason most people lose money playing options
You traded for 4 fucking months and advising WSB needs ya
Theta gang checking insticks are up 53 of the time down 47
Thank you for sharing this
Sir this is WSB
Number 3 FOR SURE If you made money take it and run 1 in the hand vs 2 in the bush mentally
you really gonna meme your money awayWell yes buddy
i appreciate you man
This is actually good advice
I kept trying to stop paying attention but then you would call me a fucking idiot or stupid retard and now I love you
If you are planning to sell the next day to 2 days out like you say why buy 2 weeks out Why not just buy more FDs for a bigger upside if you are planning to sell immediately
Youve summarized everything Ive learnt the hard way I guess we all go through our own journeys and then reach hopefully the same Burger King for tendies thanks and good luck with your positions
Thanks for this Appreciate it
Excellent advice I really appreciate it Someone else said dont try to time the peaks just take your fucking profits and dont be greedy This is the way Also fuck theta gang

Dont forget to strap up your autist helmet
3 hits home
I wish I could read
New to options still doing my research but how do you prevent from getting assigned when buying an option 2 weeks out and selling it early
Set stop losses Personally I go anywhere from 2040 BUT when u see a trend forming quickly against you sell immediatelyNote to self move from Robinshit to literally any other broker that offers a cash account if you dont have 25k to bypass PDTIve lost too much because I had no day trades left to take profitscut losses and the position 910 times reverses against me from 50 profit to worthless
Spreads are friends Cap your gains but also reduced retardation
You survived the market during the period of time that has been literally the easiest time in history to make money on options Bravo Sir god bless you for imparting your divine wisdom on us
Buy options 2 or more weeks out unless you are super confident in a move Then sell same day or 1 or 2 days after Diamond hands is a meme created by theta gang to help you lose money I wish someone had told me this last month would have made a killing on NAT calls
The bit understood best was YOU FUCKING IDIOT
good tips
If high theta and high IV be a net seller of the option credit spread I also try to sell short expiration options
This will also help with my runescape merching
OP i dont want to be negative i enjoyed your post and think you provided some decent advice for all the new RH college kids that are popping up but you have to understand experience in trading relative to the last four months is basically like saying you have experience in survival since you jumped off of a bridge once and you didnt die
ive been a trader for 3 months lol
Actual tipsuccessful traders dont write tips and tricks listsPost PL or ban OP
You forgot most options expire useless so it’s better to be a seller than a buyer the majority of the time
Off my initial investment of 5k I was at 53k of unrealized gain but lost most of it but now climbing back up with 16k gainGo on old Sage
Im sitting out because my brain belongs to overthink hold then fomo gang

Same Sold all but 200 shares of a single stock Fuck this crazy shit I’ll sit on my cash until the market burns
I wish I sat out the last 4 daysI’m down 65 Panic sold last Thursday
I’m semisitting I bought a bunch of longdated SPXS calls lol
I’m sitting out because I have no more money to trade with Atleast not until my next paycheck
Im playing futures and just expecting the market to not make any sense Bought a contract because going down after today would only make sense
Liquidated everything in the past two days It’s gonna be choppy for a while
Up day sell call down day sell put is my strategy Aint buying options in this rig market
Great now I just have a boner in the McDonald’s drive thru
I cashed out sleeping better now
Took my tendies at open About 5 mins before fed bought the free market I opened a TSLA put that I have to hold now so naturally I bought 10 DAL calls x200BGiven my positions we should trade sideways the rest of the week so I get royally fucked
Sidelining 460k today Going to wait this one out
Bought calls on xlf at open up 100
I bailed after cashing in on Travel Things looking weird right now
Im playing the game with the kang gang
That Russian girl is not going to put out
Calls since Thursday brrr
Totally went into cash today as well Waiting for more clarity either way The market has gone haywire the past three trading sessions and doesn’t seem to have a clear direction picked out
Gotta buy the dipsI readjusted some strategies on Friday but still bullish had calls on TQQQ over the weekend and some spreads on mostly tech stocksThe rest has moved to Theta gang
Nah I’m all in Speaking of which got that Russian girl’s number Asking for a friend
oddly specific analogy where in Russian they have this tradition
i blew up my account last week got a few hundred left waiting to be lit on fire
Cash gang Its a losing position but Im not trying to FOMO in
Going hard into gold and silver stocks
Um where can I find one of those Russian girlfriends you speak of
Started a new job this week maybe too much stressfor me to get involved Lol
Cash gang because of robinhood restrictionswhich is probably a good thingMight make one big play in my TD account for a couple months out but thats it
Im wondering how many of you are mostly sitting it out bc the market is like that Russian girlfriend who invites you to a family dinner where the first 3 courses is vodka and wears a tight black dress without panties to flash you from across the room while completely highbro i dated a russian girl for four years and this shit never happen at family dinnersi was clearly doing something wrong
Nah we’re not pussies
You didntfuck up if you didnt loose money
I sold most of my positions on Thursday at open Cash gang looking to fomo soonDont beat yourself up about it The market makes no sense
5 puts20 index75 cAsH gAnG
I didnt buy the dip because i thought itd dip lower
I think it is either hilarious or sad that a lot of people including JPow honestly think that we can simply print our way out of this situationThey think that there will not be a bill that will come due They think that there are no longterm consequences to free moneyWell guess what history has proven again again and again that there are consequences Bad onesI do not know when that bill will come due It might be 6 months from now or it might be 6 years from now But it will come And who will be left holding the bags
Bro you dodged that girl Have fun in suburbia with Karen and your average 401k MrGuh
I bought an expensive ass car so I cant gamble it
I was cash gang until today Now Im kang gang Market up sell Market down buy Not doing options just stocks that pay dividends so if I get stuck bagholding anything I can just put it into my IRA and give it 15yrs to recover
Sold out 95 Left 10K in see what happens
50 cash as of last week Its tough having money on the sidelines when there are tendies to be made Fed is inflating asset prices no doubt Its unknown how long that can last tho I just think we see more bad news than the fed can outpace in a couple months Q2 will be shit show and once the 6 month paid vacation unemployment runs dry and jobs arent back things get real on how bad the following qs will be The big guys will know before us They pay for access to credit card spending phone location traffic etc etc and have an early read
Checking in Sold all my calls this morning expecting a blood bath Going to take a break for a while and think things through
Nah fam you just gotta FOMO faster
I wish I knew what any of this meant smh I’m just a pleb
5 percent in puts and 5 percent in calls rolling back and forth on movements and avoiding risk for the other 90 percent The yolo is death in this market
All in on Kang gangBought strangles on jpm wfc c bac
I tried inversing myself but I literally dont know what I think I asked my gut and it shrugged
I was only in equities until last week and then tried call options and the market drops 1800Welcome to options 101But I was only 50 percent in options on October calls so I went the rest of the way in and made some back on the bounceExpected market to be down today so did one sale in the morning but otherwise was going to let it rideThat one sale at market openthe underlying stock jumped 20 percent literally a few minutes later on somethingI guess I am perfecting my stop profit trades
i sold all my calls at the top last tuesday completely accident so im just taking a week off or so trading fuck puts again im just buying the dip in my shares portfolio this time

Right here I didn’t know what I was doing before but now I’m worse thanit knowing what I’m doing I was just randomly punching buttons
Looking at premarket I’d say those calls are looking pretty good
You fucked up
Sold TSLA last week felt like a GENIUS now it’s higher than where I sold Sorry bro Right there with you
I have 150k in safe stonks and the euphoria has me worried Decided to stay long keep some cash on hand and be hedged and ready to buy puts the whole way down if something crazy happens
Youre going to regret letting those BA 200c go News coming soon about our official recert flight
I don’t see what the issue is Covid is no longer a problem we are going to normal and on top of that the fed just pumped trillions into the market and global interest rates are at all time lows There is nothing better than equities right now
Confused so do I click the green button or the red
I think your thesis on how to play the sentiment from the hearings is spot on Ill be taking similar positions
Dear DiaryOP was a good guy today
I dunno anymore bro This shit gonna nose dive but the Fed is buying corporate bonds The free market is dead I think its time to just wait for another crash if one comes and work from there Trying to time this is gonna fuck bears and bulls and whatever the fuck roo gang is
This seems pretty reasonable So probably the opposite will happen
Nice job actually used logic but we know it doesnt work
Sir this is the unemployment lineI am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorwallstreetbets if you have any questions or concerns
Hahaha I go brrrrrr
Imagine writing this long thesis being correct and then the Fed says We have decided to buy individual stonks and overnight futures on indexes And you get fucking wrecked by green bullcocksCause thats what this market is
Buy puts all around He’s going to get asked about this idiotic ballooning of their balance sheet and how long they can keep it going without creating an atomic bomb of a bubble that can crumble world economy
Sounds good are you going 5050 spy to vxx
OP why is the market Tues evening going to be red no matter what Correct if I’m wrong you’re saying1 if market responds red duringafter Powell 10a then puts 617 and vxx 6192 if market doesn’t respond then vxx 619 anyways
Im a gay bear I like this
I want pancakes in the morning
I like this hot take Ride both ways
GREAT POSTGood work OP
So what youre saying is the market will either go up or down this weekGot it
Look man I warily clicked on your post as I’m here for call confirmation bias Instead I get a wall of the same scribbles my teachers tried for years to get me to decipher something about green eggs and a pig for breakfastR MY CALLS PRINTING TOMORROW
This makes perfect sense so I don’t believe it
Today I picked up SPY 720 280p and VXX 731 40c about 1 hour after open Goofed on the exp a bit but Im a wimp
My only concern is that the futures have a big green dildo and everyone that was stuck with their stupid positions they bought last week sold after the big run up mid day that’s why there was a pull back then close green So paper hands are out and firm manly hands are still holding because tomorrow will be a big green day but on Wednesday it’s a coin toss or like WSB like to do is watch where a dog takes a shit
Great post fuck what all the retards say this is some good shit
Great DD What strikes are you looking at for your vxx calls
There is no 617 VXX
You got my upvote Solid analysis
Good DD Im glad that I read this post
remindme 2 days
Ill pass on this DD and play the chart I think we arent dipping until 320
I dont think anyone who matters in finance takes Maxine seriously but it could work for soundbites in the media thats an angle worth taking
goddamnit Im in
U said but vxx calls for both scenarios lol
What do we do if his speech pumps the market tomorrow
You’ve got your meetings in reverse Tuesday is the joint meeting Wednesday is the Senate meeting
Dude what are you doing Just buy calls and VIX puts
Hmm you seem to be very confident with your DD That said I have VXX calls I didnt unload yesterday and theyre down considerably You think I should cut them once we see a hint of green during Powells event And if we start drilling I should be holding them right Was about to unload them right at market open but Ill follow your thesis for now
Yeah that’s my move But if it’s getting ‘this is manipulated as fuck’ levels of green candles just cut bait on the VXX calls and move into UAL puts if those are moving up with them
Uhhhh can someone page TQQQ burry to vet this
i appreciate all the thought that you put into this but honestly im just going to buy vix puts because OP is always wrong
I’ve been dreaming of unloading my SPXS calls to buy AAPL calls But now I’m legit holding Well done
If youre holding an option overnight you always want at least 2 weeks DTE Theta burn for one night of holding will be horrific on 619 expiration
Good work OP please keep us updated on this post will stay tuned
Great DD thanks for sharing How long does he speak for todaytomorrow
like the idea glad i’m sitting mostly cash right now
Market makers will cause a move right when the conference starts so dont judge what will happen on the first few minutes
If the Fed repo schedule is that significant why not consider that we wont go red at all since the Fed has operations starting today AND tomorrow through the rest of the week
Sounds about right
confirms my bias and I gilded OP because you cheap pricks didnt

Honestly would short just to fuck them because thats just disgusting Fuck the SHAK
Tf I never knew that shitcan had a stock
Actually it might rally this truthfully all the BLM protesters gonna be tweeting n shit about it and shakes gonna get big attention
I put 5 into Shake Shack and got a cookies and cream shake it was fuckin delicious
WE DONT BUY NO FUCKING PUTS
I was right now years old when I found out shake shack was a publicly traded company
Has the skin colour of the cops been confirmedIf white calls
bad idea media hates cops right now and shake shacks are concentrated in shitlib areasbuy calls

So basically Stonks only go up
TLDR stonks go up Reason1money printer went brrrand JPow will keep it going brrrrrRrrrrReason2people tired of hearing batvirus newsReason3 graphs
I skipped straight to the comments so I know what to think
There is a third market methodology called price momentum Its essentially akin to buying art You purchase at X with the assumption that someone will buy at X1 tomorrowBased on CAPE and the market not giving a shit about valuations id say we are in that type of market Volatility is here to stay as well when drops happen theyre going to be larger than what history would say Ill buy VIX calls once again once its below 28

You guys are retarded if you actually believe we’re not going down again
We need more quality DD and this bunch of autists need to stop repeating how much they hate readingMuch appreciated OP
TLDR Pedos in white vans will overpay for lemonade stands
Wow actually not retarded Buy calls dont fight fed
Donny pump would never let the market dip that low again
no we wont stop asking the exact same question every fucking day
You went through all that to come to this conclusion
TLDR FED goes brrr
A lot of words but please tell me calls or puts
You lost me at fundamentals
Could have saved you all of that analysis with a simple no
Dumb kids about to learn a lesson
It would be hilarious if these fucking analysts had to eat their words again because dumb investors carried it It’s becoming abundantly clear that these professionals are getting pissed that their plans are being foiled by average joes in the market instilling some chaos in their plans
Thats the trick of the financial industry all you have to do is disclose it it doesnt matter if nobody listens Not like the people buying HTZ stock are even going to read that
I kinda want to buy some now
So their CEO is outright saying to buy the puts from the 170k robinhood holders of Hertz
That makes 2 of us
Hey OP I guess its too late to change your post but maybe the mods can help You wrote Hertz thinks youre retarded I think you meant to say Hertz knows youre retarded Any mods around to help
Cant I just buy puts
knows
They are right most you drove HTZ stock above prebankruptcy level while they were in CH11 proceedings
Hertz we want to go out of business ok now stop it RH
Hertz thinks youre retardedThey were right
Luckily for Hertz we are retarded
This bag just got heavier
so hertz 45c 821 confirmed
Dude shut the fuck up already and give me a date and a strike for these Calls I need to buy
Not wrong doe
JPOW the bond buyer to the rescueEdit not even a fucking joke They qualify for government bond buyout right Imma pick sum of them stonks
Counterpoint I already paid off my initial investment in hertz shares by selling calls and some shares Even if the price crashes to zero I’m up on the deal I prefer to hold my shares and continue to sell options In this insane economy it’s hard for me to believe a household name brand will be allowed to go poof
Musical chairs last few people hold the bag
So calls
Its like taking money from a retarded baby
calls it is
Calls it is
Bullish
Wonder how long it’ll take them to realize CHK is the next HTZ
Uuuuh yea hertz and everyone that stopped huffing printer ink when their brain cell count dropped below 9
Shhhhhh I still have calls
Do puts become worthless if they get delisted
The stock price represents how much people are prepared to pay for a stockMost people don’t know how to value a stockVery few stock prices represents the true value of a companyMost stock prices represent how people are feeling about a companyOn a long enough timeline the stock price always comes back to represent the company’s true value
Stock price is another term for hypebeast at this point
Feelings Nothing more than feelings Trying to forget my feelings of hate
Is this a rstocks question FineTheres intrinsic value future potential of a company and market demand priced in Tesla is an electric car company with a limited customer base compared with gasoline vehicles 250 stock Elon Musk also owns SpaceX privately SpaceX news comes out with more impressive shit and sends people to space boom Tesla becomes 1000 stock The people return from space safely boom 1300 stock Seeing their previous success they get ready for a launch to Mars 2000 stock
The stock represents whatever somebody somebody out there is willing to pay for itThe government passing a law that says stock prices must go up by 1 per day sounds like something that would happen in an Ayn Rand book
Stock price now represents the markets faith in the company long term CEOs are influencers and hard financials do not matterNow who is the next Elon Musk
Look at these guys who think fundamentals still matter in an environment where equities are the only assets that provide real returns Where are pension funds going to put their money In bonds that yield 0 or soon to be negative rates of return lol
Market is efficient even if it does not look like it
Measurement of big dick energy
Hopes and Dreams™
Stock price what the feds are willing to pay
aren’t stock prices supposed to have something even anything to do with the underlying value a company has to offer Have you noticed that ZM is more expensive than LK And that the former moved up while the latter moved down this yearMaybe you should take a break sit back and relax Instead of forcing yourself into the mentality of I wasnt making tendies so the market must be wrong
Price “Present value of future cash flows” which just means higher than yesterday
It represents how close they are to all the fresh new tendies that keep brrrring
Its full on casino mode at this point Stocks are now valued on how nice the dip looks
Low interest rate growth companies they are trying to get costumers with cheap money for the time when Interest rate goes up you start looking at value at this point I don’t even think interest rate will ever be above 1 or 2 ever again
Its a formula based on combined taint length of senior leadership team minus BoD
Its like luxury watches The prices have seen massive inflation as Rolex is perceived to be desirable The through value however was stayed the same ie a disconnect between those 2 price categories exists
Remember that these times are mostly because of mania among institutions and retail investors You probably got burnt on some trades like I did the last few months and you e got every right to be salty But think long termlike wish you’d bought NFLX or AMZN ten years ago long term That’s why so many people have retirement funds in the market our economy is the greatest in the world and like a good JPOW and Trump Daddy believer you should put every penny you earn behind this machine
People should never forget a stock price has nothing to do with the objective value of a stock Its a subjective measure of what people THINK its worth Its like a popularity contest for equities
it represents graphs and calculus
People have too much money what else are they going to do with it You cant spend it all so investing or betting on market is the way
mood of the top 1
The same thing its always represented supply and demand of the stock
The market is inefficient in the short run because the default among major capital holders is to sell and move toward cash or treasuries When they sell it’s indiscriminate enough to include any nontreasury liquid financial instrument including gold etfsVery few capital movers the ones who change prices daily are fundamentals oriented It’s rarely a human saying “sell stocks today and buy gold” but rather machines and traders saying “buy everything or sell everything”
Bullion is being and has been deliberately manipulated Prices are artificially low because of the futures market If bullion were determined by OTC trading we would see gold at over 2000 an ounce by now However the paper gold market is orders of magnitude larger than the physical gold market For example in 2016 the number for COMEX ballooned to 550 paper ounces outstanding for every physical ounce of gold in registered inventories httpswwwbirchgoldcomphysicalvspapergold
They’re not supposed to be inverse That would imply a correlation of 1 They’re supposed to have no correlation Sometimes they go up with the market sometimes they don’t
market is split between bulls and bears Bears buy gold and bulls buy equities Its a sign there is no consensus in the market on the future
Gold isnt a hedge against stocks Its a hedge against the economy and weakass currencyJPow responsible for death of both
I too would like an explanation if anyone on here got some insight
Ive been wondering that too Last Monday with a nice rally gold went up Then the next day was the start of the crash I was about to sell it my gold last Monday but it was actually going up On that Friday after the good unemploymentt numbers gold went downGetting into long stock positions right now is also strange The bidask spread is really wide And it seems immediately after getting into a long position somebody shorts the stock down 1 which gets covered at the very end of the day
I think when there is a risk off trade they sell everything including gold The US also goes up often in a risk off trade which is bad for gold
Because all the gold and silver trading firms leverage the shit out clients investments Basically defeats the entire advantage of precious metals Dumb motherfuckers dont give a buttfuck
Because the dollar has been dropping as fast as the market has been rising on green days This helps gold and other precious metals
market is trading off of massive deflation fears offset by j pow printing if j pow fails both stonk and gold are in trouble if j pow succeeds both stonk and gold will do good gold really shines during an inflationary crisis but the market is much more worried about deflation right now
Dollar weakness among other things
if you lose equity you have a diamond hand perfect negative correlation of 1 between metals and equity
Watch dollar DX or UUP When it tanks metals go up When the market dumps gold is a flight to safety
Hahahaha too much brrrrrrrrrr

Fuck youNo seriously fuck you and your witch bitchAlso shits going down And I hold calls
If I remember correctly we go on a 3 month bull run after this happens right
We all know how that worked out for us last time
I know I’ve been wondering how it’s going to play out Sell off all day then automatic rip to the upside in the last thirty minutes of trading That’s what I’m banking on all on calls in last thirty minutes expiring the following Friday
Yeah I learned I ain’t trying to go toe to toe with J Pow But my 619 puts are already worthless so I might as well hold
Quad witching happened a few months ago and did nothing Don’t fall for the same trick again you fucktard

Here we go again
This shit again
Yeahjust like how many of us got sucked into losing money the last quad witching fck the witches
I was wondering when someone would be this up and let the newbies knowWould have been mildly entertaining if nobody said anything and then SURPRISE

Quad witching wiped portfolio

So calls right
Last time was expecting obliteration and it went fucking up and started this whole fucking rally

Not this again
Are witches the new bears How is this possible they fly
Quad witching is about as overhyped as COVID19 shutdowns
So now we have Kangaroos Witches Bearsgay and Bullsstarting to sound like we are all in different warring Houses in Game of Thrones
The only thing it truly means is that we can expect more volume that day
Are there any witches left from the last witching
Fool me once
This wont mean shit

Can we fuckin Boog already and quit the shit
I kinda thought this sub would be ya know actual discussion about stocks But memes about stocks giving blowjobs are cool I guess
We just get selectively released news to try and prop up the market The rug pull is not preventable by the market movers when the avalanche gets going The game for everyone in power is to keep the party going until the election
Bears every other week Its going downBears the following week Itll go down eventually and Ill have my vengeanceI thought it was gonna crash this week too
The shittiest shitpost there ever fuckin was I’m honestly impressed with the level of shit here
Yep This is the classic all mighty bear flag pattern Keep buying the dip and boom Its all gone
Not sure where recover came from several of the stocks are still going down or are flat only some have had slight or significant increases back x200BHeck SPY and DiA only recently got back up and only went up by less than 1 at closing
A lot of shorts were cleared out today SQQQ and TZA had insane volume late last week So I guess we’re going down when bulls are back in town
I’m a singing Kangaroo and I’m from far away I like to hop hop hop all day So would you like to come and play We’ll hop hop hop hop—what do ya say
Youre so sure about this very specific plan but you cant tell me if its going to be one or two more selloffsWhat exactly am I supposed to do with this
Been trading since Jan and Im convinced the market is a cuck fest on retail traders that dont know shit or how to do any analysis
I think youre really overestimating the brandnew cringe normies Theyre placing it all on household names like Nike and Microsoft
And blood will run like water and darkness will cover the land while the bears roam free to devour our tendies
Bro you have reached your final form Congrats you win WSB
Will you let me know of your next trades so I can inverse you
You can always lose more on margin

Your country needs you to buy puts

Thoughts on spy goin up or down tomorrow
Its like the institutions market makers and HFTs have a backdoor trojan on my brokerage accountYou didnt think your transactions were private did you
That’s quite literally what RH does They sell your data
You arent unique Options are zerosum People who win big and continue gambling will eventually lose it all Inversing yourself also wont work because of the nonlinear nature of derivatives you will eventually go to zero with any aggressive strategy The only way to win is to manage risk very carefully
Obviously your mind and strategic thinking has no value but have you tried selling your body for tendies
If ten of us keep this guy bankrolled we could just inverse him and be goddamn billionaires
You haven’t tried one thing buy spy at the end of the month every month and hold for 30 years Can the market invert this play
Welcome to the club
Mind buying some PCG 13P puts for this friday
Not unlucky just retarded
Make sure to post your positions so I know what not to do
this reminds me of the 5 consecutive plays I got wrong before finally deciding to legitimately pick a play with the most logical reasoning that I could and then do the exact opposite and still proceed to lose again for a grand slam failure of 6 fails in a row

Damn thats hard mate RIP Delete the brokerage account and watch the institutional investors scratch their heads predicting the market without you Then offer them your services at huge fee
Do you have an alert group for your positions

What the fuck was the first play

Why didnt you roll your sold options I looked up the stocks you sold options on they didnt drop 400 to where there was nothing you could do It sucks but try to learn from what happened and add that in your toolbelt Selling options is boring but its consistent
I mean I lost 8k in a week so I feel your pain ZM puts destroyed my profitolio so Im back to working at Wendys
Bruh hate to break it to you but despite what people say herethere are things called stock shares
Taking a break is the best thing you can do right now to regain your mental composureWhen you come back stick with your play unless external event you didnt account for fucks it up then cut your loss BUT in order not to keep making all wrong moves your next play cant be FOMO into what fucked your previous play You need to step back and think trough your next idea for trade from scratch to avoid ending up in losing streakIts better to sit out for a day after taking a loss and do homework on next play that makes sense than chasing fomo and following other autists after seeing them print without thinking about your moves
I think your saying it as a jokerobinhood absolutely sells your data
You should deposit more and try inversing yourself
Bro you could have just threw 10k into spy shares and sat on your ass
Seriously I close all my long positions on Friday because I cant take the stress of bearing with losses anymore Shifted my money to buy puts and the market got pumped up on Monday This market is not normal anymore Lets see how long it can sustain
Keep trading but at the last second just do the opposite of what you were going to do
Maybe stop trading options retard
F I’m sure you’ll be back
Seems like you just have a legitimate gambling addiction
Have you tried having more patience than for 5 minutes
Drooling version of Warren Buffett when he was in his primesYou may want to keep that ability by eating crayonsMight be useful one day
I don’t think you understand theta gang You sell CCPs on stocks you want to hold long term Because if you don’t get assigned you pocketed the premium If you do get assigned then your limit buy went through and you kept the premiumYou sell CCs on your assets because if you don’t get assigned you keep the premium If you do then you kept the premium and your limit sell went through Most theta gang strategies — like the wheel — are just buy low sell high with extra steps
You deserve to lose all your money if you buy back puts at 400 lmao
By being autistic enough to buy and sell randomly
lol this is the daytraders dream market
I’m doing just fine
I buy stocks on red days and sell calls on green daysBought some NKLA yesterday ill net 600700 just for listing the callhttpspasteboardcoJdlkUEfpng
Only big boys win They let some small fries win just to make more people gamble
Up and down are what some people were waiting for It helps if you have 25k in your account and can daytrade more than diamond handsing and you look at TICK data etc
Up down left right The market has done one thing for 3 months now and that’s go up Calls my man that is the way Unless you’re buying OTM calls a week out over and over again Then yea a couple red days will fuck ya
Nobody tell him
Preach it brother I pretty much have been on hold this entire time waiting for a solid bull or bear to come out
Imagine having unlimited QE and zero interest rates and still losing money
Up around 33000 this month httpimgurcomgallerytPmqAEO
Stop crying because you losing adapt or BAN
its fake completely
You should consider the wheel Mildly bullish Collect theta Let others trade the market You get paid either way
Day traders love this volatility
u mad
it’s not much but i’m 18 up YTD
Just buy something that the price never moves on
Stop trading charts that have already happened Think ahead Team America fuck yeaaaaaa
Kang gang
I would yolo all my money on price charts going from right to left soon who wid me
Its not a zero sum game Most of you have this mentality that if one trader wins their transaction partner loses But between earnings and injections and new debt flooding the market stocks should be producing more winners than losers
They announced it is kangaroo market your trading style must also adopt kangaroo patterns
Gee if only you could buy something that doesn’t lose theta
When the market goes up SOMEBODY has to be making money
I love this market
It’s only going up budI know it feels like it’s not but if you buy calls and manage your bankroll you’d be up
Old bear who made money and lost it on the crash and recovery I have tripled my very modest account over the last 2 weeks even with a PDT restriction just have to embrace the full retardation of the market and be cautious for pullbacks
Im doing ok myself im up 400 overall and my first option hasnt gone to hell yet but ive taken a rather conservative approach to this crazy market
Ive spent 2 years studying stocks and economics for a potential depressionthx ray dalio and this corona thing have been green for meThis drop from 3200 was shorted down to 3k area It held 3k from thursfriday into monday Rebound since 3k is fomoIf you read the FED latest release they are buying shit bonds and etfs with 101 leverageMarket is mostly fomo and buyingI have calls from 3000 3015 3025 and 311505 3200 put sold the restStudy charts learn TA read what the fed is announcing and doing easy moneyIts bullish to 3200 atleast
Volatility is your friend
Bruh volatility straddles have been going BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR like I don’t give a fuq how the market moves as long as it does something I’m in the green
It’s uh Kang Gang Gang Bang on Bulls Bears
I have been Kang GangLong spreads and selling options as a means of getting paid to commit to positionsI am only gonna sell X for 360 gonna sell covered calls of X for 360I wanna buy Y for 69 sell covered puts for 69Doing so limits my profits but also pays me to have a hard limit on losses in a way that isnt selling lowBuying puts on held assets for spaces that have a chance of cratering is a small fee to avoid bottom outside as well and gives the option of making more should the market swingIn baseball it isnt the big home runs that gets a team to the world series its their ability to play little leagueHits to get on base steals and sac flies tactics that get tallies on the boardThis market is the same place your plays to edge out short term gains instead of sticking around for the wild ride trying to get to the topPlace them smartly and you can be betting on both teams as a positiveJust cut and carve your small chunks of gains from the marketBe prepared for it to run away on you into the green or to bleed out deep red the most unlikely outcome is a holding pattern staying steady
How are you not making money
The fuck do you mean it’s called buying calls on the dip 22 SPY 717 330c bought at 300
Theta gangs make
I’m doing fine did some short term buys and sells Holding onto some stuff till next year Also have my dick in a vice so I mean things are fine You are worrying too much sweetie
It would be a very odd casino if most people were winning
Bro you’re not the only one who feels this way This shit is illegal
You inbred Play both sides options and you can’t lose with good timing
I was winning until some fucking dipshit on here told me to buy puts I thought last weeks bad dip was an everreaction and it didnt bother so much Anyway his comment stayed in my head all weekend and i sold off monday morning but decided to not buy puts and go cash I should have gone with my insinct and left everything instead of listening to some fucking retard on here
Im making moneyIve lost a shitload in the past but learned from it I think I was down 400k at one point from options I had the exact same rage and questions as youThen I realized if I am losing money someone is making moneyI went and actually learned everything I could about options and its scary to think I was trading options before that If you are buying calls and puts now you are losing moneyEspecially if you bought yesterdayWho is making moneyThe person selling you those calls and puts ie meIf you buy meme stocks during regular trading hours you are also buying them from someone like me who bought them cheaper premarketThe news would have you think everyone on Robinhood is destroying all hedge funds and prosIm nowhere close to as smart or experienced as them and I am capitalizing on the opportunities here

North Korea isn’t a good proxy for anyone They’re too weak and desperate and CCP wouldn’t support them North and South have been officially at war for decades Some tantrums by Kim Jong Un won’t change much He’s just trying to force negotiations to get a bit more humanitarian help
At this point it really feels like nkorea is seeking attention Lets really hope things wont escalate further with america and china

Nobody tell him
they exaggerated to make your rejection less harsh calls
Your taxes are bailing them out just so they can keep fucking you in the ass
Smart move by Delta but puts on OP
Fewer people more profits calls it is
Yeah the Fed is definitely going to have a large amount of airline bonds in their “broad market” portfolio You didn’t get a job and now when taxes go up once Trump is out of office you’ll be repaying the debt the country is taking on to bailout the company that didn’t higher you Even if the markets go up near term this fucked us all for the rest of our lives
Feel like airlines are more of a short term call long term puts kinda thing
Companies slimming down is actually bullish for the future So much dead weight got fired in my company its much easier to get stuff done now
and United just took out a mortgage on their frequent flyer program lolShit is looking dire for airlines for the next couple yearshttpswwwcnncom20200615businessunitedairlinesfrequentflyerloanindexhtml
Ive been flying throughout covid and the number of people flying since march has easily tripled on the west coast Yeah theyve been hit but people are most definitely flying again
You’re right about how the 95 load factor is going to crush airlines but your timing might be too quick Fed bailout flows for the airlines through the summer likely they’ll keep getting these retarded fucks to “BTFD bruh” until AugSep After that the bailout money dries up and it’s downtown poundtown with the gay bears
Priced in
i too smear my screen with piss emulsion
Lol ban Stonks only go up Calls all day bb
Dude this is bullish
Delta has started reopening some routescalls it is
Works for delta yet puts on AAL Calls on AAL puts on OPs lender
Now that was some deep ass cover
Ive been flying throughout the east coast and mid west for the past month on Delta I can tell you right now this shit is probably turning around quicker than they were expecting The airport a month ago was a ghost town now it’s fairly crowded again flights are starting to get oversold although at lower capacity route volume is being added back weekly Today I saw more blazer bro’s than I have through all of this so business travel is definitely on its way back Delta lounge was one in one out with a significant line they had about 50 of the lounges in the airport open Flight prices are increasing to reflect this demand Based on what I’ve seen at the airports Puts are definitely not the way to go
Only down 80 you dumbass Bullish as fuck httpswwwtsagovcoronaviruspassengerthroughput
Well fuck guess I’ll say bye to my job too lol
Cutting overhead this is good for my call debit spreads
Does it really matter Look at what’s happened with ccl or rcl They basically have no cruises scheduled and they still spike here and there The traders are still thinking everything will go back to normal and they are “investing” in these companies
You needed an update from DAL to know thisThere have literally been hundreds of articles saying the same thing
My counterpoint bbbbbbrrrrrrrrrr
As a pilot I can say that United is the one fucked Their operation banks on international flights and they operate next to none Delta doesn’t use any regionals besides endeavor airlines and a couple others but American Airlines will be okTSA has said there’s an increase in foot traffic through airports Up 500k people now Airports are becoming full of people In fact at American we are turning people away because of “COVID CAPACITY” limiting flights to 7880 American has its trusty 3 wholly owned regional airlines who operate half their flights at a lower cost as well Q2 earnings will be higher than expected but still be very low They had 6000 pilots take early retirement and more on the way AAL also just got rid of their Boeing 767 and 757 aircraft in favor of the 787 that they are still receiving from BA
And permabull retards think robinhood retailers buying the “dip” will keep inflating this bubble forever smh Somewhere in the future timeline there is one day one really bloody day A day that will stay forever in the stock market history It’s just a matter of when
Time to buy some delta calls

I dont know why i read it cheesecake
You think people here do TA Youre even more retarded than
I have a degree in accounting which is not as useless as you might think but sure as hell not as useful as I thought
I went to a Special Ed College
Economics degree from Harvard and then worked at JP Morgan as a Trading quant market risk analyst specializing in vix and credit default swaps Surprisingly taught myself a lot more after I left JP Morgan than I knew when I was there I think the fact that we cannot really day trade any stocks of our own in those roles prevents you from actually getting your hands dirty and really learning However I will admit the training was intense and got a very aggressive intro into everything in the realm of markets from the trading perspective x200BTLDR Harvard didnt teach me shit was once smart money but now just stupid smart autist Hidden in Reddit is an education
Have a marketing degree It helps in terms of knowing the ins and outs of a corporate entity but stonks only go up so school was a waste of time I’ve made more money trusting the vibe
Read Nietzsche Logic is for FAGGOTS like Plato and Socrates Listen to your instincts mine tell me stocks only go up
Technical Analysis Horoscopes Chiropractic
I got a degree in programming and that helped me learn the most cause I make money and deposit it then when I lose it I make more and deposit it
TA doesnt work when theres unlimited money being printed just trade momentum and cut losses when it turns against you
College educated but everything I learned is self taught if that makes senseGot myself a couple internships in banking and accounting during college that helped a lot too Books books books Investopedia YouTube Tons of free info on the InternetBook recsHigh Probability Trading The Intelligent Investor Securities Analysis Liar’s Poker The Big Short All popular for a reason
TA has a bad wrap on here because people here dont know how to use it TA isn’t some magic bullet it just gives you areas of higher than random probabilty Whats important is understanding what that TA represents ie trend consolidation over extention poor or low highs points of control value areas auction and price acceptance Look up order flow and learn as much as you can about volume and delta
Go on Twitter and find some people who trade some of the same names you do Lots of people post charts Follow a few and see if you find them useful There’s good info out there for free but you need to sort through some trash
TA Is bullshit Literally just go with the flow
TA is useless in a kangaroo market
I went to college to yolo my financial aid tendies
BA JDLearned more about investing on my own
I come from a family of financeYou learn a lot between the drug use the polo shirts the judgment for wearing the polo shirts the selfloathing the bonus season the crashandburn stories the hatred from the general public the stupidity of educators stuck making 50k a year Most people are stupid is the mantraWhen you start off there theres really only one direction to go until you generate enough bitterness to just ruthlessly win and never look back
Tastytrade is a good learning websiteapp and have “shows” to learn from
fundamentals CFAtechnical this is vodoo
I self learned myself Thats always the best way book learnin is for stupid suit dummies They didnt really get learnt themselves the book did it for them and theres no pride in that
Computer scientist here TA in terms of candle patterns supports or other astrology isnt very helpful but there are absolutely some technical things such as Monte Carlo simulation that are useful for analysis though some would disagree with me on this A lot can be learned on your own but there is tons of relevant math and algorithms for the stock market Im a newbie myself but differential equations linear algebra and statistics can be super helpful for instance for modeling commodity prices or pricing options based on the random walk assumption Outside of literal price prediction you should know something about the Kelly Criterion for instance and if you really come up with a good trading strategy you want to make it algorithmic and backtest it to get some idea of whether it really works Or at least use bankroll management for your YOLOs
Business Admin Real Estate finance from USC California furloughed from my acquisitions position after only 4 weeks and down in the markets BUT I can run you through a DCF and price bonds In all serious though a top business school gets you a job not tendies But happy to be an autist with my fellow retards
Im retarded either way I young man young man make big gamble with 300 left to name young man make risk young man make win young man learn from past mistake to make big good young man play less risky young man trade good good gut feeling young man feel satisfied
I am selfinternet taught started to learn properly about 4 years ago using investopedia and their simulator got distracted for a while by fomo in digital bitmoney in 20172018 thats when I found this sub as well Memes here were hysterical and it brought me back to stock market I have continued learning from free resources on the internet and test my ideas on paper trading At last I finally got around to open account at IBKR and started trading stocks with real money in second half of 2019 Meanwhile lurking WSB and got into learning and paper trading options By start of 2020 I was making nice tendies on meme stocks from small options gamblesEDIT I am not succesful been up to last April where greed got better of me
I learned the most by following retards and inverting their positions
Im from the school of hard knocks If you wanna learn TA you gotta start by learning the tea cup the upper cup the round cup the put out the out puts and the knockdowns Once you know those you gotta learn the turn dips the whiff rips the lip slips and the flea stacks After that you might be able to start doing your own TA but dont count on it I didnt choose this life it chose me
Raised by wolves
College educatedBanking Finance graduate here 1 of my fav lessons was a case study on George Soros v BoE My dream is to one day YOLO my entire life savings and be amongst the legends inspiring young minds of the future

When I was about 22 I worked with a guy who moved out here to the Midwest after 911 He was an options trader in the towers and was walking into work when the planes hit He couldnt go back after that day without trauma so he decided to move his family here to where his spouse is from and try to become a teacherI remember back then being interested in the markets and he tried a few times to explain options and Greeks and boy was I just not able to grasp the now simple concept YouTube wasnt around yet in 2004Anyway I tried looking him up because I wondered how he might feel about all this going on and found some cool OPEDs he wrote in the paper on anniversarys of 911 and a city paper piece about his career as a teacher He was the nicest guy and Im sure hes affected a lot of kids lives well I figured why even reach out about this shit if he didnt want to deal with it back then Selfish of me probably So Ill just remember fondly his poor difficulty with my smooth brain wondering how options worked and how nice a guy he was Plus hed probably tell me Im retarded for buying OTM shit with 80 of my balance

Last night when everyone was talking “bull r fuk” and “CB incoming” I posted the following“I did one thing wrong during the pandemic shutdown and subsequent recovery I bought puts too late We’d already hit the bottom Every circuit breaker day I thought it couldn’t keep plunging but it did Finally got in and the recovery took off immediately and didn’t stop But that didn’t hurt much because of the thing I did right bought the fuckin dip Watched my poots go to zero and didn’t give a single fuck because that rally was face ripping SHOP shares doubled in 3 weeks Shares not calls Lots of shit like that Anyway you can be wrong in one direction here and be fine But what you can’t do is be late to be a bear and then late to be a bull Don’t chase Buying puts tomorrow is a sucker bet IV and theta will eat your ass Hold a little bit watch some things develop FOMO is the enemy”Calls are going to be like that tomorrow If you held calls overnight tonight good job You’re winning maybe take some profit If you didn’t no fucking sweat you’ll get the next one Buying calls tomorrow is chasing Resist the FOMO FOMO is the mind killer

Dear diary today was the most american day in my entire life
Why does the Fed still allow the market inefficiency that is selling If people can sell securities then their value can go down an existential threat to market health If the Fed simply eliminated the ability to sell prices would rise continuously
OK I see a lot of retards here that dont really understand whats happening The FED making this announcement signals just like when they lowered interest rates the first week of the first crash that they think a crash may happen this time too However with bonds so expensive they know that if a crash materialises much of the liquidity will be drained not only from equities but also from bonds As bear JPOW said last week remember retards they dont want liquidity to drain from bonds as this may cause trouble even for solvent companies to refinance their debt This message by the FED is pretty much a if things go wrong please go into bonds we got your back Also it means that they expect deflation which is a BAD signal they want to keep rates low without having to control yields
Last night everyone had puts but magically no one got fuckedLets see that loss porn

Man I’m glad I am not near retirementThis is a scary timeFeds have taken away price discoveryThey continue to say no huge bubble being created yet they keep doing things that have never been doneWhy are they neededThey are the ones making a huge bubbleThis may run up for a year 2 years 3 years but when it busts people’s retirements will be devastatedThey will lose it allThe Feds are concerned with the short term while not giving a fuck about any consequencesBeing younger I’m not worried about getting though it but I feel bad for those that are 50
How many times in a row can I bet on spy going the wrong way
Amazing how being 1 day off on your moves can completely ruin you
This is the biggest bubble in stock market history wouldnt be surprised when it pops and we drop to 160180 range and stay there for 5 years
Bears you can have futures again

Imagine having a free market without worry of government orchestrated manipulation
I’m retarded

Bears fucked bulls fucked kangaroos fucked
I honestly dont even know why I try to play this ponzi scheme
Nice bought calls at the top
I really cant wait for my puts to expire worthless Ill be free
I hope everyone made money today or learned a lesson Remember we are all out to make money not fight with each other
I literally haven’t had a single profitable trade in over 2 months Every time I buy an option it immediately goes the other direction waits until the day after expiration and then moves in what would have been my favor and it would have been ITMIt’s the equivalent of taking a 100 question truefalse test guessing on every question and getting every single one wrong
LMAO at the posts last night “Ok bears this is our moment Just remember don’t get greedy take profits at 265270 tomorrow”
Just woke upMY PUTS WILL PRINT
The spy that shagged me
These market makers are so fucking ruthless they dont even wait for retail traders to trade during market hours they just say fuck it lets trap them during futures
If you have puts selling and taking profits is commendableAnd by taking profits I mean transferring them to your bank accounts
Bulls gonna try really hard to see SPY 300 one more time
CNBC really out here trying to get a limit down day they basically just fucking said to sell everything

Everyone talking about wave 2 and the economy not shutting down again it doesn’t matter if we shut down or not if there is in fact a strong wave 2 more people will stay home voluntarily that’s if there is one and if it’s worse People will do things in their backyards grill out and eat at home enjoy summer in their yards Yea you’ll get people who don’t care and go out but consumer spending will shift Instead of that family vacation to Disney people will dump that money into doing the basement or making a sweet patio setup I don’t go out and spend nearly as much as before wave 1 and quite frankly I don’t miss it

Funny calling bears commies when our central bank is clearly going to be the next worldwide Banking farce
Bought a VIX call like all you autists said at opening and now I am down 60 Id have a better chance flipping a coin to make decisions than taking advice from this sub smh
The sentiment here seems to be buy calls I’m gonna buy puts This is euphoria right now This big of a gap up after a correction seems suspicious as hell Even with the feds backing the market

Imagine using TOS Get a real broker like robinhood
Considering we were 4 overnight this is incredibly disappointing
The year is 2025 Hertz has just acquired Amazon
The year is 2058 For 38 years SPY has vacillated between 290 and 310 As you stare off into the distance you feel a tug at your sleeve Its your grandson Grandpa can you tell me about Bulls and Bears againBefore you can answer his mother chimes in Oh honey dont fall for your grandfathers tall tales You smile at the boy and nod at his mothers wisdom Of course theres no such thing as Bulls or Bears just as theres no such thing as UnicornsThe boy shrugs suddenly bored and returns to playing with his stuffed animals a massive pile of toy kangaroos grotesquely inserting limbs into each others pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy A quiet rage flares behind your eyes then fades to sadness
Bulls who are still holding your calls youre a fucking madlad and I respect itLike you woke up absolutely assblasted then God himself lowered his hand and pulled the markets up out of oblivion And youre just like nah want more stonks go upGodspeed retards
See you tomorrow guys I aint even bothering with futures tonight Shit ghey
Don’t worry everyone I finally caved and bought some puts so we will inevitably be green today No need to thank me
Imagine trying to make a living doing this shit

plot twist 2nd wave was made up to spark fear in the markets and allow hedgefunds to buy the retail dipseriously jim Cramer gets compensated for pumping stocks on his show given that its naive to think billionaire hedgefunds arent connected enough that they can manipulate medias to their will
Nice “pump” you dumb fucks are toast

Lesson learned Futures dont mean shit
Whats the refund policy on options
This is some weird shit
seems to me that everyone getting bored with COVID is actually pretty bearish now all thats left is the stark reality of the underlying shitshow our economy is going to be for the next few quarters nobody gives a shit about vaccine news that might result in a vaccine 9 months from now and hard to see stimulus coming if were accepting that people just need to die and masks are for pussies
Lower highs lower lows
Everybody always asking where SPY is headedBut nobody ever asking HOW SPY is doing
God my life sucks right now wtf
worst day ever
Why is the market moving up Good thing I realized I was surrounded by retards who would inverse current economy conditions I knew this bitch was going up regardless of my bearish natureI hate you all
Seeing bears get fucked caused my desk to raise 3 whole inches
Even 3 future cannot guarantee a red day
I crossed 25000 does that mean I can day trade unlimited
To all the true bulls that diamond handed through the great bear market of the week of June 8th 2020 I salute you
I really wish the market makers would just share the plan for the day we could help them so much more if we knew
Note to self don’t lose sleep over futures anymore

JPOW had a late start but hes here JPOW Gandalf confirmed A wizard is never late he arrives exactly when he means to
the entire market is a meme stonk at this point
you had 400k at some point and didnt pocket 200k you piece of garbage
400K shit dude and you ran that back to ground didn’t even stop at 200K or 100K congrats you belong here
This made me sick to my stomach
When you get things right so far and dont believe you cant lose Lessons learned when the trend changes do not fight the trend dont let your bias cloud your judgement Have a game plan with an exit Have a plan follow through and dont get emotional Dont go after memey stocks especially when you dont know anything about it like oil Stocks that did well in crash do extremely well in the trend upwards ie tech Definitely Take out profits
how do you not stop at 300k and think maybe i should reevaluate my life choices
Looks like youve been buying puts since early march and gave up right before last weeks drop
The bear cycle1Bet that some stock is gonna drop and win tremendously2Hold the same belief for a different stock and lose either all of what you made or more
kinda looks like my portfolio except my alltime high was only 216
what made u get to 400k in the first place lol and why the hell didnt u cash out like 100k
The 3 month graph looks like fckin Mount Everest
At least you can tell people you used to be rich
Half a million but cricket doe
This looks like my 3 month But with less zeroes at the end
You fucked up lol But respect on reaching 400k thats impressive Take profits next time Damn Im happy taking 1k profits You greedy
Bro I don’t understand how people don’t bank a good portion of crazy gains like that
Need some background to this story
At least you dont have to pay tax for the gains you never cashed out
Same here I peaked at 80k and then now sitting at 12k The printer sucks
How the fuck did you not cash out in April with 100k At that point it was so fucking obvious the bottom was past gone Well we are going to crash again soon so learn from your lessons and don’t fall into the diamond hands trap again Don’t take the permabear and permabulls memes seriously either I will pretend to be either of them sometimes but in reality you should trade like a degenerate coke addict from wall street in the 80s you dont chose any sides you choose moneyOne of the best and simplest ways to deal with huge gains like that is to sell everything roll half of the money into the same callsputs but with longer expiration date to avoid getting you rear end destroyed by theta gang Hold the other half in cash Then just observe whether the trend is reversing or notProps to you for not being a big faggot and offing yourself Lambo southeast asian ladyboy hookers and cocaine land dont come to you without losses first
That makes me feel a lot better about losing a 35k account
You coulda bought a house but more importantly an iphone

Damn This sub is a case study of Gambler’s Ruin OP please google that shit and save yourself a lot of grief in the future
Im surprised how are you not still ITM on your ICICI puts theyve barely recovered Also figuring out the domestic banking sector is hard enough Im amazed you put down so much of your money buying puts on an Indian bankAlso I cannot imagine ICICI options being a very liquid market that peak there just doesnt sit right probably some very wide spreads on the options
I see hs on your balance
Holding my IBN and HDB still That shot is coming downnnnnnn
was it HDB by chance I rode that bitch down in March for like 15k but then almost lost all of it by holding the position noped the fuck out of it and never been happier
Ahh the ol A shape regression
Sorry for your loss bro hope everything works out for you next time
Why would taxpayers have to stimulate the economy with money forcibly taken from them when banks can create it out of nothingwuthttpswwwredditcomrWutbotPosts sourcehttpsredditcomrEconomicscommentsh8dybtgermanypusheselectriccarsin145bstimulusfuqnf7t
it’s rare anyone who gets from 10k to 400k in one play keeps it if u get there gradually after 1000s of plays there’s more likelihood u ll keep it by then u ll have rode the rollercoaster long enough to hop in and out on your own terms
That was a fucking emotional rollercoaster
God damn man
You just sat by and watched half a million dollars burn right in front of you over a month and didn’t think to pull anything significant out You belong here
Well if you look on the bright side you won’t have to pay much in taxes
uvredditdownloader
Is your complete account made up of 400 contracts now When do they expire
I can’t watch this again It gives me too much anxiety
Bruh I could buy like 3 income properties with that and retire
what the fuck is up with the influx of people
You area moron bro A complete moron
Which Indian Bank puts can you tell
Youve been up there once do it again Just dont take the slip n slide this time
DUDE What is wrong with you
400k and using Cricket Pretty sure that explains it There I said it
I went from 5k with stocks it was 17k to 100k but was a retard and sold my stonks and put them into options Ended up taking bigly losses losing it all pretty much Dont feel as bad after seeing OPs losses We can do it again OP
Stonks
Nice
Suddenly I feel better about my overall 30 loss since February
Yeah but when you cash out of Tesla making like 10k instead of 485000 peak another day was like 24 milly because you sold too early when it first jumped to like 950 way back right after the Super Bowl and u had loss the week before around 10k so now your like sure you broke even whatever dont be greedy It goes both ways oh well just live and learn
DIAMOND HANDS BABY
Lol
Im reading your replies and you sound wayyyy to fucking calm for someone who just lost 400k and an extra 10k from when you started
This isnt a bear post Its just some retard who didnt take profit
Do you get a panickyhopeful feeling when you think what if I took the 400 put aside 100 then used my sick gamble with 300k on the ride up Probably be at more than 2 million you could put 750000 aside then keep going with the 125m with 850k in the bankWhat ifs are the worst part about this game but holy shit this is one of the craziest things Ive seen in this sub They better flair you up son
deleted
Loss porn like this saves lives You’re a hero of the WSB community But you’re also a bear
I cried for you man I put in 8k in April was up to 14k and with the dump on Tuesday I got out with 3k profit but lost that extra 3k and am beating myself for not taking profits Can’t imagine 400kid probably lose my mind
This reminds me of grabbing the 400 degree skillet that just roasted my jerk off hand
eh you can still make it all back
Totally get it happened to me too but it was play money Biggest advice I could give you is to get off RH since they dont offer trailing stops on options Then always use trailing stops Even if its set at 20 its still 80 more than nothing At the least itll force your emotions out of it
Fuck man are you mehttpsoldredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsh0ytcytheliquiditytraphowqeandlowratesmightbeftqueh5Edit Mine took place over four years though
Im convinced the all or nothing attitude that allows people to get account balances of 400000 in three months is the same attitude that causes people to lose 400000 in three months
damn half mil its not fuck u money but its i can fuck two hoes ass at the same time moneygood luck man
What Indian bank puts you holdin
Dropped your spaghetti
So what happens to taxes

Ima take a crack at day trading like this So far at 4k doubled money Wish me luck
Considering how retarded you are it was just as likely you could have been a millionaire by now Then again you probably would have just lost it all eventually

I bought and sold puts on SPY at two different points today for profit bought and sold SPY calls at two different points for profit and at 2 pm on the nose bought 100 QQQ calls and sold them 25 minutes later for profit Fucking kangaroos I was absolutely fucked by TVIX though
Kang gang is basically my whole strategy Itll go up Or back down Kang gang tells me take the money and jump away
how do you trade a kangaroo market
I cant day trade at all so I loaded up on both calls and puts today so that I can sell either or both tomrw Puts for 619 and calls for july Some puts could decouple from the overall market due to sector DKNG LYV SBGI HTZand go down even if markets are up I held all puts over wknd and switched to kangabull around 11 AM
I’m a singing Kangaroo and I’m from far away I like to hop hop hop all day So would you like to come and play We’ll hop hop hop hop—what do ya say
Not a kangaroo market This is the Turtle Market Buy the cheep healthy companies and just sit back and let the tendies bake Up down who gives a shit when the biggest best companies are all on a major sale Stop watching the market so close Pick a dip to buy and HOLD Look at your worst buys last month they are all way green if you would have just held If you buy optionswell you all know you’re gambling there and you enjoy it so do what you want Turtle beats the rabbit kangaroo the bull and the bear Nature’s deadliest predators are all patient Buy the dip HOLD you won’t regret this easy money all while sleeping like a baby No need to do DD watch the news or plan when your HOLDing

Kang gang booooooooy
Can we have a Kang Gang flair
I dont even know what the fuck is going on anymore
I’m just waiting for some juicy bear loss flanks to roll up dip to 296 and hoped back to 300’s

Imagine if the protestsriots and the whole media agenda with inflaming and supporting them was part of an inside job to destabilise the West destroy economies in America and Europe with social unrest and a huge 2nd Corona wave and then have China emerge the world super power with America and Europe socially and politically divided obsessed about race and pronounsWe live in a strange world
Two things amigoWhen covid strikes it doubles every couple days When heavy protesting strikes you close testing centers in their pathHave you factored this in Tests conducted vs positiveIm genuinely curious
Dont try to time the next covid crash if it even happens it might notinstead treat this as a risk of investing and hedge against it with a long dated SPY put Im holding one SPY 11202020 24000 PIf I start to get the sense that were gonna have a big red day I will just nope the fuck out of my longs The next day Ill wait and watch the market open green anyway and buy back inThis is the way of the roohttpsemojipediaorgkangaroo
Cases dont matter only hospitalizations matter The question being asked is can the system handle the sick people We will not stop the spread the early spike only put demand on a few places maybe 2 were at capacity Late winter is also the most dangerous time for respiratory diseases RSV Flu COVID and the likeWhat I can almost guarantee you is that there wont be another shut down unless its driven politically the system will handle the sick people and eventually nearly everyone will be exposedHere are some tipsNever listen to the media OK thats really the only tip There will be pushes for more mask wearing there will be temperature checks there will be increased sanitation there will be targeted assistance to those most at risk Im 98 certain there wont be another shut down Source Emergency Planner FEMA team Emergency Medicine for 20 years and wife is a CNO at a hospital
Hey statistician now please use your powers to normalize by number of tests Thank you
You want me to play spy for September All the way in September Get the fuck outta here with that bullshit I need tendies in like a couple weeks homie
You forgot that stocks only go up
Does your stats degree tell you how much jpow will print Cause if its more than covid deaths spy to 400 eow
You ain’t get the memo Jpow will keep the markets up till a vaccine comes out get in position and bend down Jpow got a BGC for you
I was about to post about this watching the news drinking wine and all i hearPekin new cluster just doubledUSA cases on the rises Florida on the rise over 2k everyday BUT we’re bot changing anything we’re just giving the alarm but keep doing it make america great great again againMission texas in curfew for 14 daysBut the FED the fucking fed pumping the market like a 12 inch penis pumped to 12 inch Since there’s a lot of small PP around here you know what happens when you pump too much
The market craves natural selection
No one cares about the virus stonks only go up
Count these two middle fingers will ya
Let’s face it no one gives a fuck about COVID Yeah people die but no one gives a fuck
Cases mean nothing We all have it
What makes you think shutting the economy down will make SPY drop
Dude covid is so April 2020
Until out of left field Clorox does the unexpectedSodium hypochlorite vaccine
Have you like not even heard JPow yet Fuck your stats and your pandemic
The actual mortality rate from Covid is much less scary than previously feared and continues to drop CDC finally admitted this a few weeks ago estimating it at 024 originally in the 34 range The median age of fatalities in nearly all western countries is 82 years old Life expectancy in the US is 7854 years old If and this is a big IF we as a nation can get past politics and fear mongering of it then we can implement continue special precautions for high risk individuals and let everyone else get back to work continue on with their life w modified normal If you are under the age of 24 you literally have a higher chance of getting struck by lightning than dying of Covid It’s time to end the forced lockdown nonsense of healthy individuals
Jpow is a broken record with a personality to match Alsothis confirms my positions so I agree
The Fed has eliminated corporate bankruptcies starting today Until the Fed is broken this awful market will continue to balloon

Good DD Im curious about the time frame when the hospitals will start running out of beds Do you have any data on of covid19 cases vs of hospitalization If I can roughly figure out this ratio I reckon that I may be able to predict when the hospital capacities will become full again depending on of beds each hospital has
Not til lockdown pt 2 happens It’ll take hospitals filling up for that to happen We are closer to a vaccine every day
considering the estimates are pricing in 200k US deaths by Oct the only way the market will care is if that number hits at least 1 million otherwise its a non event and everybody carries onSPY 350 by Nov with less than 500k deaths
Cases flat while deaths continue decreasing Do that mathhttpstwittercomCOVID19Trackingstatus1272287039724023809s19hint were getting efficient with how to treat it you know for the 1 it harms
I’m a retard and I also don’t feeling looking it up but is the testing rate consistent with before I had a theory a second wave would be “created” simply by increasing the number of people tested
even faster over the last 34 days which I presume is due to the recent riotsI agree with your general thesis but I think the current spike has more to do with Memorial Day weekend state reopenings Protest cases are still on their way and wont really ramp up for another week
Positive vaccine news crushes any other bearish news and i expect positive vaccine news to come out in July This could either be efficacy or production quicker than expected
You’re not gonna like this and this is coming from a bear but this is priced in
I’m in Puts on COVID
the fed does not care how many covid cases we have they boughtbuying everything market can literally only go up
for a lockdown to happen hospitals would have to be completely overrun to force politicians hands to do something given all the pressure to keep the economy going i think americans are willing to let people die at this point especially since the mortality is primarily limited to the old and sick that said if you could crunch hospital occupancy numbers ie covid19healthdataorg and show that sustained and accelerating infections will overwhelm capacity then im in for shorting when we hit 320 this week again
The market has too much money that the bucket is overflowing SP might go down but still that money will be pouring to all these stupid fucking biotech company suggest if youre gonna go for a gamble get into biotech
We already used our shut down card well get another one when we pass go again in a few years
Since you dropped your stat creds how are you normalizing data based on number of tests administered
Priced in imho
Any statistician would know that case count is a horrible metric because we have not had consistent testing throughout the pandemic Of course we have more cases now we are testing a lot more What about death counts That’s a much better metric
Honestly dont believe you can attribute the spike to the protests Most people in those are wearing masks staying somewhat spread etc Have you been to any of your local shopping areas I tried to go to IKEA on Saturday it was near maximum capacity and busier than I have ever seen We are spiking because fucking idiots think its over and are trying to get back to their normal lives And not wearing masks and social distancing
Im here in Bolivia and La Paz is getting requarentine d in July There were protests against the quarentine like the states will the same happen over there maybe but not for long due to protests and with money printer goes brrrrr stonks go up for how long GDP affected
Nobody cares retail sales up 18
In other news pneumonia cases have dropped to zero no one knows why
They will issue lockdown only for senior citizens its like the flu for everyone else anyway
Now you should graph this with another line that shows number of tests occuring for these days as well
Donnie isn’t shutting down the economy ever again Plus imagine all the savings people will have now that they don’t have to pay for their annoying moms nursing home That money’s going right towards a vacation BA 280 1218

Yeh everyone knows its mom and pop yoloing spce calls
The majority of robinhooders haven’t even gone through puberty yet so they can’t be a teen mom or dad yet
Because RHs used their mom and pops ssn to open the account
Mom and pop Most people on this sub havent gotten laid ever or else not in years not sure how they would have kidsThose with spouses regularly lose access when their spouse swaps them out for bulls or bears who are making tendies when market goes the other way per the comments people post I guess its possible they have stepchildren they owe child support on but arent theirs that are half bearbullkangaroo
named by people old enough to be our mom and pop
Is that what they are calling autists now
Given the fiscal responsibility of Robinhood investors I doubt many of them are moms or pops

Yes premarket action is manipulated very badly with front running or pump n dumpsIts become very bad during the last years They expected trade war because thats why Donnie was put in the White House so they pumped up the stonks to make money before the crashThen they did the same thing before the each new round of tarrifsThen they did the same thing before the corona because insiders knew since last Winter some shit was going down They have data for online searches and population movements so they can tell that was going to happenNow they do the same thing before second wave or more international problems
If sum1 is buying before the RH and is flipping when price is high due to RH investors buying loads and dumps It is clear that RH investors are the ones bringing it up hence rallying the market in fact the influx of new investors is the factor causing rally not the fact they loose money The money they loose it still in the circulation or in other stocks being pumped the next day
I mean Im buying popular Robinhood stocks pre market and selling them at 930 or 10am EST so I imagine others are tooIn fact thats the main reason I come here to see what the flavor of the day is

Yeah we kinda knew this was going to happen months agoAnyway at this point we are just waiting for the economic fall outValuations will stay crazy high for quite some time
The Fed is just catching up with the other central banks that have been doing this for years
Idk if anyone can tell me but why is this a celebration for a bullish market Also how does buying bonds increase inflation I must be retarded cause I do not understand this
Last week JPow fucked the market giving hint the US economy was going to be shit until 2022 Then right as things were looking to balance out government begins to buy shit up for cheap Technically this is how the government can legally control corporations

lmao so the Fed is buying bonds with their own printed money
Doesn’t this translate to “we don’t have confidence in economy and hence we are stepping in again”

Fed says it will buy individual corporate bondshttpswwwcnbccom20200615thefedsaysitisgoingtostartbuyingindividualcorporatebondshtml
This market is irrational Fed is pumping into corporate bonds in order to bring liquidity to the market Two things are really drawing red flags 1 The push for more liquidity to be given to corporations is pointing a big solvency issue that the big guys are facing They are just giving a little more time for those corporations to jump ship 2 The odd behavior in the market today that had a constant trend upwards even reversing market internals seems extremely shady and I think there was some insider information that went into this
Gay rights dont cover
Was obvious af Always inverse wsb This sub was fucking hella bearish last week and thinking today was gonna be a slaughter I bought spy calls in the AM and sold my VXX calls Lolol
its a trap
What are bondsOh FUCK thought this was Google
Yall bears been warnedSimple as that
I first saw a comment on daily thread Fed to start buying individual corporate bonds I thought it was another one of those goof comments until I saw the huge green candles I knew then it was true I just shut my screen and went outside for a quick walk just to process what had happened This is going to be so impactful for the coming years I dont think not many can really fathom the full impacts of this
You must be new here Stonks only go up

Don’t get greedy homeboys MMS will fuck every1 Fucked those holding calls at open fucked those that held puts will probably fuck eveyr1 at close too
Honestly I feel bad for bears because I was one of you two months ago I kept being stubborn thinking theres no way the market can keep going up Two months later its still going up The only reason I recovered my losses was because I abandoned all logic and just bought calls I would encourage all bears to do the same for now
This is just a low volume pump for the gap fill There’s no volume but also a lack of sellers Where does the market go when there’s a lack of sellers
So since it would be bad it can’t happen Endless QE worked so well for Venezuela and Zimbabwe right Can’t be flawed

bear gang just cant get a breakI went straight after closing my short for 33 last weekglad I could resist the temptation todaywho knew that being smart and logical was so gay

How many times have you gone to bed with blood red futures only to be cucked by J Pow and some announcement at the start of the trading day One day he will run out of ammo Until then my ass is wide open
Hope none of you were on margin Fuck margin Shits a lame trap
spxs
I bought SPY puts at open today Im pretty much numb to losses at this point
Honestly I’m proud of my diamond handsFor context I am 130k cash 25k bear Brazil etf 45k puts total mgm UAL and ccl for 717 and 100k in vanguard ETF I went cash on Tuesday sold even more Wednesday to reach 130k So I avoided big damage Thursday edit plus had Brazil etf so I was basically flat Then Friday I said if there wasn’t a big bounce markets would tank Monday Markets were going to tank Monday but jpow buying more bonds was definitely known by some I made the right play but the marker is manipulated It’s sad at the same time because the American people like in 08 are going to foot the bill to bail out these corporations We’re near all time highs because of the belief in the fed We have a credit crisis 20 unemployment no international travel supply line issues and a global pandemic I will happily let the bulls march over me They win Money doesn’t lie But I’m still proud Sometimes the right decision doesn’t lead to the best outcomeCheers
I had 2000 at open I’m now at 638 and will probably lose everything tomorrow
Buy a call and a put for a month or two out Sell whenever you’ve made money on either The way this market is going that might make you a millionaire in 3 days
Today literally was the day I lost faith in the integrity of the market The manipulation exhibited here was disgusting and wrong Either way I’m glad I’m neutral gains I ain’t putting a dollar until I see a honest correction of this pseudorecession market
Manufacturing report up almost 50 from last report

Oh my god you retards never learn Whenever bad thing happens Powell step in and make better
The FED announced that they be buying near bankrupt individual corporate bonds And only managed to get a 16 pump Imagine the legal ramnifications of having uncle sam as the creditor in a chapter 11 filingSome bears did win today those that shorted the USD index or any forex with USD pair

I dont know how you guys dont get this Stocks only go up
deleted
“Since I know I can make it back” Way too much confidence for just losing 10K
Damn looks like you never were up though Maybe inverse yourselfnext time
Check this guy out he “invests”
It’s never a loss until you sell
My favorite part of this is that you somehow bombed 10k without options Lets imagine ways you could have used that money to actually make money1 Have a diversified portfolio of reputable stocks2 Buy magic lessons and use your newfound skills to pan handle in Newyork
I wish I can go back in time and tell the 18 year old asshole of myself to never ever fucking get into stocks let alone options
Keep a positive outlook its only money but dont downplay the seriousness of a loss like this Its a huge fuckup and that money couldve done wonders for you if just invested long term in basically any FAANG stock and not traded away
Have you tried buying HTZ shares
F
At least 18 years old is the time to lose it If you were 40 and had a family then shame on you Starting at a great age though you’ll be fineDollar cost average every month 50 into SP 25 into Dow and 25 into Nasdaq You won’t be retired in 10 years but you’ll be happy 30 years from now Be careful on here and don’t get caught YOLOing for tendies again
I did the same thing at 19 I had another 10k to invest and had a job as well That’s not a lot of money in retrospect You’ll make it back dude Gambling is bad Try buying an sp500 index with most of your money and only use a bit of it 10 to gamble OTM fds
Positions or ban
That old JcPenny
Its hurts now Wont be a lot of money in a few years Dont get too down over it
You suck at this
Sorry for your loss Blame it on RH as they don’t let you short So when market drop your money goes bye bye
Don’t call it investing Call it dildo self fucking
10k at 18 So you either took out credit or are just a rich boix200BI had to work from my 10k loss you punk
This is the way
Time is on your side You can afford to make plenty more mistakes with your money Also Yolo your last 128 on some out of the money SPY calls 330c 617 and close position before end of day if you get some profit
Lol 19 and i made 20 from a 300 gamble get humped kid
That was youre saving or what
Kidz kan play too
Brutal What did you learn from this
Just don’t kill yourself ya retard
I’ve made 10K lost it made 15K lost it made 20K and lost it Almost 50K in gains unrealized You’re not alone retard
Im in the same boatam down 95k all time at 20 still have 4k in stocks I hope some of my stocks turn around
portfolio size next time 80 to stocks 20 to optionsor better still dollar cost averaging every month into SPY VOO or any index funds

You got 128 it isn’t over yetThat being said take this as a life lesson and go make something of yourself Go work hard for someone else and let them train you then go start your own business and create wealth then come back to this game
I hope you didnt put it in spy 500 calls
Im at Like 200 loss in reality but had a 11k Position march 19th Thanks for making me feel less retarded
You will get them chief
Youre like a young Warren buffet
There’s no point of the graph that’s higher than the initial investment
You belong here
You’re 18 go get a degree and a job You’ll find 10k is a drop in the bucket once you start working full time You’ll also have a steady income so you can fuel your gambling urgesoops investing needs
Dude where did you even get 10k at 18 Stop trying to invest and use the money to buy drugs and give some ladies a good dicking Come back when youre 22
Hmm if you lose 10k youll be able to lose 100k

Incredible lack of effort in your spinFuck your puts faggot
Way to fuck up all my calls
You are the Michael Milken of coin flipping
Except of course that today is gonna be green AF
The way you flicked the coin instead of simply spinning it leads me to believe we will see SPY up 5 by EOD tomorrow instead
You need a Bull side and a Money Printer side Bears dont exist anymore Fed will start buying babies to be slave labor if it means the markets will go up
in australia and can confirm this is true
I wish I didnt inverse the coin last time Trust the coin

Market is up gay bear
Well that was a lie
Was waiting for a stuffed kangaroo to come knock the coin off the table
Horrible You should have multiplied x 100 on the PE ratio Otherwise solid work
Algos better watch out
My guess is this is the flip that will discredit you
50 chance you are right
coin went off screen at 007 and was likely switched with a double gay bear coin
I bet thats how JPow decides the stock market day
Bullshit our lord and savior Powell will not let such blasphemy not go unpunished

My “will to live” on one side “ definitely no will” on the other side Been lucky so far

More importantly where can I buy this coin
I bought both put and a call at the same price what ever happens I will make as much as I will lose
Psychological if you were going to bet on one or the other and you got mad at the bear outcome then you know you should bet bull You will be correct 50 of the time but at least youll feel good about it beforehand
I sold my puts
All I can say is for personal experience I have a Kroger 5 min from me and I’ll drive the extra 5 to get to HEBAlso I know most small town have Dollar Generals that’s where we go when we have to buy groceries when going to the ranchAmazon will obviously deliver everywhere but Prime isn’t available in smaller towns and with longer delivery times on most everything coming from Amazon during lock down they were obviously affected too I know this because ranch Can’t get prime there but you can get in the truck and drive to Dollar General and all the little towns in between have Dollar Generals and parking lots always have cars thereI was in on United Foods and they ranked 20 after they beat their earnings estimatesKroger will most likely be a game time decision but this isn’t a grand slam or a guarantee I seriously doubt this will be a Dollar General 20
this did not age well
If this is legit tomorrow I want one of these videos every day until it is wrong
As much as I want my puts to gain value the futures are already at 15 up
PPT is in force tonight Futures mooning Tomorrow will be a bear back to todays close The coin fails because there is no Kangaroo
Where did you get this coin I need it for DD

God if we are actually somehow moving the markets because we are all following a guy spinning a coin I love it and Im all in
OP you were right once already you are 50 ahead of every DD out thereIf OP is right twice i will put my toe in my mouth
Howd u record if u flipped the coin with both hands
International markets and premarket are ripping up Hope you Amerifats dont ruin it
MFer cant even spin a coin
This way isnt a 5050 chance when spinning a coin the side facing the outside when spun more likely to be the final resultThe side facing the inside of the spin is less likely to be the final resultYour spins are rigged just like the system
What if it just kept spinning
This is the way
Carnival cruiseline earnings this Thursday puts it is
Guess I should’ve seen the NCR winning the battle after all
No sorry bull gang can only read goldBear day wrong
You could be right There’s a trump press conference and big daddy J is talking today as well I’m more curious about jpow since he can move the market more but either way I’m talking out my big plays this morning to minimize my risk

Did you just draw lines and make that up
Doesn’t seem safe to bet against a stock that is going parabolic and loved by retail investors because of a very simple easy to understand narrative Everyone is just thinking Work from Home BUY ZOOMThere needs to be a change in that narrative before the stock plummets otherwise there is going to be aggressive buying of the dip when it does drop a bit
Even your dumb ass drawing says its going to 250 so why short it now This could go to 300 easily not much difference psychologically between 1200 PE and 1800 PE
This the dumbest stock out there Puts all day Will crash soon 2000 pe
You drew a head and shoulders pattern before the head and shoulder formed
As soon as everyone returns to work school they are dunzos

Love it Now we just gotta wait for the perfect timing to drop a meme when the kid beats up on Schneider to this song later in the movie ”We’ll hop hop hop hop WHATAYA SAY” get the door
This was my favorite movie as a kid and this just became my favorite meme
Always remember that this condo costs about 35million

I fuckin love little Frankenstein I love the McDonald’s scene where they went to get breakfast If you haven’t seen it it’s called Big Daddy and it’s a staple in all our Autistic lives It’s an absolute must watch
Who are you rooting for The gawdam jets
Thank you be careful of front running and pump n dumps Whole market is rigged scam Anyway I make money if the market goes up from my long holding stonks I make money is the market crashes too But I dont like how banks and hedge funds are using WSB Robinhood and other brokers to steal so many young peoples day trading and options trading money and then publish fake news that that the big boys are not in the market atm
Bear bull kang the market will always be there The only thing that makes me shit my pants that is deflation Imagine having 200k mortgage 20k car loan and 40k student loan and losing 25 of your income Puts on millennials and zoomers This is boomers giving us a good bye fuck you right as they die What an evil generation
My autist brain cannot comprehend so much technical analysis What do we buy
Lol theyre just going to put a hard backstop on everything arent they
Deflation puts for daaaaaayssssso stonks naturally will go up
I lost 18000 today and want to dieWhen the FED just says they’ll buy corporate debt and stocks in unlimited amounts I want to throw upNothing makes sense any moreI actually want to die
Wait why do you think bonds are expensive Im thinking theyll continue to go up till 2022 with interest rates near 0
Was really hoping to come here and inverse this guy but my positions are similar FUCK
Ive been thinking the same that a lot of what the feds doing is signaling that they expect a crash to happen and that theyre going to facilitate a smooth leg down instead of a flash crash that blows funds up
Ah yeahYield deez nuts in ur moufJPow
I feel like the move today was frontrunning something as well
The Fed literally said we were on course to a recovery and we would NOT be in a crashAlso this must be rerun week Im seeing people posting similar threads that have been posted before to increase their upvotekarma count but they put no effort in the posts and dont add anything original to grab attention

Don’t fight the FED Your puts are worthless you
Uhh Im pretty sure well see signals in the emerging markets prior to us you know since were the global reserve currency What youre talking about is bigger than what happened in March and thats not gonna happenIts gonna be in small cracks from overleveraged countries like JPN
You’re not wrong No matter which direction we go due to covid oil demand will only go up next 13 years 80 of my portfolio is in oil I believe
Assuming there is not major conflict and that the dollar doesn’t just fall apart overnight I believe oil will eventually go higher but not yet Global Supply is still far outpacing demand Yes there may have been a back log in demand as economies opened but that will soon be filled if it hasn’t been already We will find a new oil demand level and producers will have to adjust to balance with that new level This could take another 612 months or more Once the new equilibrium is found that’s when prices will rise to a profitable level for most producers that survive
NopeAs soon as demand picks up so will OPECThe longer they hold the price down the more it hurts the US producersPayback is a bitch
Got it Calls on zoom since itll survive the heat death of the universe
This is why I like to day trade XOM when nothing else is going on You get to profit from the up and downs in the short term while knowing that you are safe from bagholding the only danger of day trading since XOM is a good long term hold at these prices anyway
So calls on TankersGot it
Why did USO tank so much comparably more than say XOM Newbie in oil thanks I’m advance
Im not going to get into tanker gang even if it was the last thing left listed on NYSE
LolUS shale makes money in the 4045 rangeSA makes money at the 25Why would SA say they will not extend the Oil cuts againBecause they want oil to stay above 25 but below 40
Just got some USO calls at 28
GUSH has been my money maker
There is so much storage built up it will take time for demand to be able to overwhelm supply in the short run Saudi is also pissed about the fact that some OPEC members are not actually cutting the amount they are supposed to and Saudi had to pick up the slack OPEC might actually fall apart due to the lack of cooperation Also is USO still tracking the front month I thought they moved to latter part of the curve and is actually going to get blasted again when the curve go into backwardationI have OXY calls though so I still agree with you
Puts it is
I think we will still have cheaper entry points on this strategy to come
Oil is not backed by the fed and is currently pricing in a successful reopening with no future lockdowns OPEC cuts are a large wildcard as is the second wave It’s much safer to make calls elsewhere in the market right nowI have worked oil and gas for 18 years and am actually looking to heavily short oil once the market hits fresh all time highs
Late about 2 months sonBeen riding XLE calls all the way up
What are you priced in at
Im worried about the USO investigation though Anyone know more about thatAlso thoughts on GUSH
Fuck it I’m in
Been in XOM 70C leaps for a few months and going well
Thoughts on OXY and it’s midterm outlook I’ve got quite a few 918s hanging out there that I’ve averaged down again over the last week or so
So what is the tickers your invested in
RDSA 50c is cheap right now
What if this is peak oil Totally seriousEVs are taking over the streetsAir lines are pulling back for 2 yearsConstruction is going to be limitedAfter all this time well have a huge supplyWhat if demand rises sure but prices dont
Great plays If you have really big balls you can also buy CL futuresjust watch out for consomething Consamba or conmambo I think
Remind me 2 days
Long calls on XLE XOP oil etfs
I have ERX 30c 717 so I hope to god you’re right lmao Also ERX 23c 619 oof
Im in longer dated XOM and BP calls right now will add or rotate into some other companies over time I feel like the oil price rise would be gradual so this is a gift that will keep giving for a while All the oil biggies practically move in tandem XOM CVX RDS TOT COP BP can pretty much choose any of them if you are like me and risk averse Otherwise just YOLO into Marathon or OXY
M R O 710 85cRide the mass reopening wave into the busiest July 4th weve ever seen
Ive got USO at 2650 a share When should I start selling I was thinking 30 but should I be trying to ride it higher Im looking to make money short term like within a month or two
This turned out pretty good so far Oxy up 10 premarket
Think Oil
Will be opening up short positions on oil tomorrow for July since tankers that arrived in March have still not been unloaded but hey a few more people are driving
XOM calls baby

We got the weekend to take a break
Good advice for wrong people
You know wsb is full of retards when „act like you‘re in a casino“ means you should trade more conservatively
So whats the play for tommorow
Cash is a position
”This market isn’t going anywhere It’s an election year and there will be volatility til 2021 Take a deep breath it’s not going anywhere”Kang Gang
Fuck you my dopamine is depleted from years of drug and porn abuse I need some sort of dopamine rush to feel alive
Gay Buy hertz

I have a whole lot of money to lose and only 30 years to lose it I have to hurry
Sir this is a Wendys drivethru
shitty trade ideas go brr
What is this rinvesting P
That was autistic brb buying 10k shares of HERTZ
Might as well ask me to not breathe
Positions or ban
I see more downside than up right now The market however is batshit crazy so I’m waiting for the drop to start before I start shorting I ain’t about to fuck with JPOW when the rest of the market is happy to play pretend economies
Gotta chase those sweet divvies
If money isnt on a play it is wasting space
after losing 25 of my portfolio last week could have been way worse i was up to 40 at one point i decided to back off this week and go back to more of an observe modex200BIm realizing this more and more Its better to pick your spots wisely than be in the market every day
Dont tell me when I can and cant lose money
I wouldnt call poker gambling
This is good advice If someone cant stop trading for a few days then that is a clear indicator that they need to stop
U can only make money if ur in a play thoThis message brought to u by the 20 today gang
The way you explained it was perfect
I take a break when Im out of cash Still not retarded enough to do margins
But addiction tho
This is great advice for new traders Ido this as well Patience will pay off and minimize your risk combining this with having and sticking to an exit strategy I personally have lost on very few trades not totally of course There are gonna be losses its inevitable but anything you can do to reduce those losses will help to turn your portfolio overall into great gains
But if you are learning trading tiny positions often is a good way to learn
Yeah I sold my puts Friday to take a break you can see how well that idea was Rebuying immediately 93000 am eastern
good advice
True words of wisdom also these things are much easier said then done Practice patience via fishing and other methods to build the proper habits But when you see prey pounce
Positions or BANNN jk I really like your position which is take “mental health breaks”
Youre in the wrong sub May I recommend rinvesting or rstocks
i need to listen to this its hard i keep overtrading and losing
Okay warren Buffett
OK buffet
I can smell the OPs vagina from here
Okay see this is like saying “you don’t need to drink” to alcoholics when the bar is about to open
This sounds like responsible advice But it’s 100 wrong When markets are super volatile like they are right now you can make life changing money Right now is a golden time to YOLO not sit on the sidelines
Ban
Time is money BB
Sound advice but if Im not in a position it dont feel right
Buy Hertz Its going to Rally
This is how I plan on making my money when I quit my day job So definitely trying to get as much exposure as possible
So are you a bear hoping that you can get idiots to sell Because I’m cool with that
I dont get the poker analogy because I dont gamble I am an investor who invests in OTM SPY calls
The only reason Im up on the house was because I played black jack 4 hours straight until 5 am the last time I was at a casino went from starting at 400 to 350 by the end
What’s the right opportunity RIGHT NOW
i mean sure but i remember when they had kino forms at the fucking buffet tablesand your waiter would take orders for the sports book while you atesome people were literally gambling 100 of the time
False Cash is the only investment guaranteed to lose money from day 1 inflation You should always be invested Where you put the money should be based on a prudent and careful analysis ofjk just yolo calls all day
When in the fuck has the market ever been flat besides like 1970s
I tend to go to Vegas for 48 hours and gamble 100 of the time
Needed this
Sometimes thebest trade is no trade
You lost me at “you don’t have to be in a trade 100 of the time”
Baker Hughes getting a nice bounce today
Ya but what if I miss the opportunity that will only ever happen once in my entire lifetime in the 5 minutes I dont trade
You are always in some kind of trade Holding USD is also a trade
Yeah this is absolutely my biggest learning experience When I formulate a plan execute it I make money Sometimes I lose but then I think I’ll try to make it back make a rash decision and make things worse I end up reacting to stuff rather than thinking about it For sure a good lesson
I want more than anything to buy a bunch of shit and let it ride but this volatility is too juicy
Wait what
Stonks go boing
No I would be gambling 100 of the time in Vegas
Haha very funny Everyone already knows you dont make money if youre not in a tradeI park my money in stable products like HTZ over night and trade into longshort TSLA over the day I only use margin over night if Im 51 sure HTZ will go upFiat is for getting from A to B not staying in
Positions or bAN
Sound investing advice Ban this faggot

That’s where you’re wrong alwayswinning
who taught this moron how to trade
So if I have a 5 sitting around I shouldnt buy FDs that would take the world ending to make a dollar
ban
Good take but this is Wallstreet betsThis is for telling people to lose that last 7 after blowing 93 of their account on SPY puts
“You don’t have to let bad bets right” all of my bets are bad bets this point so are you just telling me to get stopped out until my portfolio is 0
sounds pretty gay to me
I scrolled down but I didn’t see OP’s positions
idk why do i feel like a bitch right now for being in the cash gang
Time in the market is more importanter than timing the market All in on something all the time
When playing poker I go all in every hand
We are all the chevy chase playing black jack in vegas vacation against the grand nagus himself

youll know weve had enough of his shit when we start calling him GeromePee
The printer has been turned back on in the last few hours SP will close positive
Sounds like a
i have a feeling the market won’t ever crash again Fed prefers to have a sidewaysup market even if it gets stagnantslow than have a down or free flowing market They want to control it very easy to tell
The only way a crash could occur now and jpow could do nothing about is if 6090 percent of 401k cashed outMarket is all about supply and demand and I bet he is seeing an outflow of liquidity from the market into cash so to buoy the credit markets he needed to jump into bondsWe have a HUGE solvency issue by huge talking 2030 trillion short of purchasing spy bonds next best optionThis is unprecedentedjpow just gave Adam Smith a big ol middle fingerThis will end badly just look at volume last few days Tomorrow would have had spx down 510 percent on heavy volumeEarnings in 2 weeks everyone knows we b taking mighty dump
The Stock Market has had SECFED manipulation since the 70s and botsalgos since Etrade started in the 80sAlso the Fed is about to kill volatility with their 0 rates and other policies so just make standard plays that would make sense 12 months ago because we are starting to head back tomorrowThe RHWebullZero commission dumb retail investors are dying off as they give up or finally realize those ads dumbed down how the market works and will soon stop being a factor in about another month Many have been burned by dumb plays Hertz will be the next to claim victims
wtf are you retards saying this everyday forim a bull but hurr durr im scared of what the fed is doing hurr durr muh free marketyou dipshits think a free market has existed in the last couple decades you think the SP500 has recovered every single selloff in its history because of a free market lol its been manipulated and fucked with for ages you dont have a god damn clue whats happening just keep gambling weeklies stop pretending to believe you actually know what fundamentals and economic data does for short term market outlook
Fed cant really improve the economy bur they feel they can at least help the markets which maybe will help a littleNext up stock index purchases
619 puts or bustQuad witch gonna cast blood magic spells
I get your point but the reason why the fed is doing what they’re doing is because it will cost much more money and time to rebuild the economy from a depression The free market essentially died along with the stock market crash of 20072008 That is why they will do whatever it takes to stop history from repeating
Its the circle of life therom The Fed is just trying to prop the market long enough that the next stimulus comes so that Business feel comfrotable in rehiring and the fedwants a mass exodus of rehiring not just 10 people backOnce that happens the Circle of life will be completed and thats when the fed will stop
How do you think the election would change the market Or do you guys think it’s priced in
Found the bear posing as a bull
The feds stopped the free market in the first place they made the order now they trying to mitigate the damage their order caused That was not Corona a shut down was a new experiment ordered by the government so they are responsible for the damage how hard is that for people to understandIf it was truly a free market business would not have been told to shut down under penalty of law Imagine the justified outrage if the fed did nothing after the government used the weight of the law to stop the markets Really and a bunch of bears bitching because they couldnt see the fucking obvious The government was going to fix the problem they caused Corona didnt cause it weve had pandemics before and didnt shut down
Unless they are just waiting for all time high to crash the market again which I doubt I’m sure they are doing it for people who will retire that’s the main reason

US stockindex futures Tuesday morning saw early gains deepen following a report of a potential treatment for COVID19 that has proved successful in early trials A report from the BBCand other outlets say that Dexamethasone a cheap and widely available steroid is being seen as a success in low doses to combat patients who are suffering serious symptoms from the illness derived from the novel strain of coronavirus The BBC report was from a study led by a team from Oxford University which included 2000 hospital patients who were given the steroid and were compared with more than 4000 who didnt get the drug The report indicated that for patients on ventilators it cut death risk from 40 to 28 and for patients needing oxygen it cut death risk from 25 to 20 Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average

He did this several times for smaller amounts before risking 170khttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsh0l5uw200kyoloonspy612314312putscreditspreadftmvua4This is part of the reason why I am not a fan of theta gangHigh probability of small gain and small probability of large lossIt is hard to maintain discipline and position sizing once you collect juicy premiums on options that expire worthless

Morgan stanley is as retarded as wsb
Nasdaq already recovered not sure why this is even a topic
Morgan Stanley is pushing that so hard Can someone get any data on call derivatives that they sold
Is there specific criteria x down then y up in z amount of time that defines a vshaped recoveryLooks to me that the recovery already can’t be vshaped
these fucktards have never been wrong
Look at it from a reality standpoint What else could it possibly do other than recover over time

Anyone got access to mike Wilson’s stuff If so send it
This more than anything tells me it’s time to short
He means the Corona virus right Because it looks like that is heading for a V shaped recovery

Imagine how hard they must have been trying not to laugh when they issued that statement They definitely think were a bunch of a fucking retards You fuckers are literally their money printer
“no listen You will literally all lose your money “ brrrrrrr “alright then here are 500 million new shares idiots “
The memes just write themselves at this point
This is a perfect opportunity for us We always boast about losing money here is a 100 chance we will
HTZ 3c 1121
What if hertz is the stock RH users got for free
Can’t make this stuff up
They’re using reverse psychology All I hear is buy buy buy
Can’t go tits up when you already tits up
The open interest on options for HTZ is insane You have to wonder if theres actually going to be a spike on 619 due to the number of contracts expiring I just did a quick tally and theres over 114000 open contracts totaling about 9 of the existing shares expiring ITM on 619 plus 24 short interest on HTZ There might be a huge short squeeze this week on this dying POS stock
If those autists could read they would be very upset
hrtz calls got it
Well in the wise words of Warren Buffet Buy the dip you faggot
Cant go tits up if there isnt even tits
INVERSE
JPows Fed bought Hertz bondsMight buy stonks as well if asked to
HTZ will be a penny stock by their own actions we could do a hostile take over to see if they still think it’s funny
I keep telling myself Im done selling calls on HTZ but this bitch wont die and its too juicy to pass up every time it bounces up
Somehow my puts still won’t print
But apparently the Fed needs to help companies acquire more debt
Imagine when they issue the new stock and nobody buys it and it falls to 0
They dont realize that WSB guys will eat this up big time for almost 100 guaranteed epic loss porn posts Literally cant go tits up simply buy stonk guarantee loss post and infinite karma
Literally can’t get any worse than this Time to load up boys
So 5c 612
I wish I knew this before I put my 55 in
We need a hypno bear to tell us how to profit Like can we short it down to 0 Bagholders need some lube when the music stops playing gonna hertz
Any reason not to sell calls or buy long term puts then
So I buy right
The order book is going to be 100 retail
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvIxs9vGIzPFshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvIxs9vGIzPFs Give it a week let it happen
I went to them this weekend they ket trying to push these Nissan Versas definitely short
How long should I hold a put thenI have 619 25p
This means buy calls
Sounds bullish
The crazy part is that some people will have read this and will still lose money on delisted hertz equities
Inverse this YN
I bought HTZ puts at open this morning and Im somehow down even though the stock dropped 3305p 71705p 11521
Seriously though what happens if you buy puts but the stock gets delisted
Pulling an aurora cannabis over here Next year they will do a reverse stock split
guys im really worried i wont be able to get any shares i usually wake up around 2pm will there be any left for me
how do I short
Does this mean I go all in on shorting it
So why should I not buy puts
I shorted Hertz at 5 thank RH guys I won’t have to cover it anyway free premiums
The title seemed so absurd that I had to look this up yupits realhttpswwwcnbccom20200615hertzsaysitexpectsstockholderstolosealltheirmoneyinfilingforsellingmorestockhtml
Hertz has tits growing from front and backWhich side is up
reverse psychology bullish
I’m on all in
I can see it now Theres going to be some oneparagraph DD that boils down to car printer go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR HTZ 717 30c followed by some jawdropping loss porn a month later

I think I missed it Im going to have to wait until the next bankruptcy to get in
Last time I checked the borrowing rate to short HTZ shares was freaking 99
Ive never seen you guys be right about anything so Im guessing HTZ pulls off a recovery and hits 20 by the end of the year
I have the best gains believe me TVIX 0615edit this aged poorly

TVIX and VXX can move a ton after hours I rode TVIX up and I have ridden it back down The VIX is fun to watch when there is a falling knife event Unfortunately this is often when the government intervenes
Puts on dow nasdaq vix lolllMarkets may take 50 to 60 hit in coming months as depression hits us

What I don’t get is that this basically is saying the markets need a shit ton of help and if people know this why buy Just cause the fed is going to keep the markets from going extinct Why is the fed even helping the markets Markets have nothing to do with the economy you can have an amazing market and shit economy so why not just help the economy instead the actual shit the fed is made for
What does it all mean Basil

This isnt new though that is what the facility was supposed to doIt is nothing new not sure why everyone got a boner over it todayI guess hope is still there
This is not even news This was announced on March 23 I think and is the main reason for the markets rebound but the program didnt start buying immediately Also its individual IG corporate bonds and HY bond ETFs Not HY bonds The HY ETF portion is also meant to be boosting price discovery of the HY market to provide liquidity not for rescuing high yield corporationsThis is not what moved the marketHYG ETF seems to be celebrating pretty prematurely though cause it rebounded a significant amount from the lows The fact they are not actually rescuing individual companies I think at least the oil and gas portion of the ETF will still be facing a lot of solvency issues HYG is def a good short

The socalled ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning highrise Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view ie the fear of falling remains a constant The variable here is the other terror the fire’s flames when the flames get close enough falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors It’s not desiring the fall it’s terror of the flames And yet nobody down on the sidewalk looking up and yelling ‘Don’t’ and ‘Hang on’ can understand the jump Not really You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond fallingDavid Foster Wallace

Somebody is going to smartly buy 1 million puts on Hertz then get destroyed when Amazon buys the company for pennies and all the HTZ holders post their massive gains and tell each other how much better than Warren Buffett they areNice try Fates Sideline gang
Follow this guy if you want to lose your money
Literally cant go tits down
Got it Stay away
Anyone read that thing When do the new shares drop
While u can BAAAAHAHAHA
I would rather invest in a Ponzi scheme than give any money to these guys
This really is my favorite thing to follow from the sidelines right nowSince we all dont know shit over under 25 weeks till hertz hits 15 lol
deleted
Just imagine the crazy company history Hertz will be able to tell if they survive and even become successful
Thinkorswim Go fuck yourselves
no joke i am on a cash account have a cancelation in process and then it executed two of my trades and i have a negative balance this is legit
Top notch doublespeak Any trades you would have made are hypothetical because their platform was crashed Perhaps if you had written the trade you wanted on a piece of paper with a timestamp they would reimburse you
Think or swim takes their name a bit too seriously
So basically go back to robinhood if you dont like it
I moved my account to E Trade Executed the order this AM
I never though Id say this budi Im so happy I pulled all my money from TD to Robinhood last week
Interactive Brokers FTW
Fidelity gang rise up
People got fills for canceled orders lol Maybe time to try Tastyworks
I thought it was just my shitty internet this morning Very cool
i would guess they mean like if you didnt already own the stock or option

I have thinkorswim and TDA application Any suggestions on which to use
A lot of shitty stuff going on with TD Ameritrades Think or Swim platform since last Friday WTF
Brokers are going to fuck everyone if you’re around long enough trading futures or options short term Doesn’t matter if youre on TD or Robinhood or a fucking platform registered in the Bahamas that lets you avoid PDT Servers will crash orders will stay pending because of overwhelming volume options will be frozen because of a reverse split I even was knee deep in LFIN puts when the Nasdaq halted them for two weeks for being sketchy Some shit is just bad luck You need to have automatic orders that are GTC trailing stops that are your backup and already in the pipe and have liquidity Otherwise pair your max risk with assuming the option expiring worthless Seen the same shit since 2015 They don’t care They’re calling all our bluffs all while taking commission fees This is the game I got 2 from Camping World lawsuit last year LOL you’re not rich and making the rules friends with the supplying liquidity It’s over Move on
Same stance as Robinhood during the great crash of March
Simple Since this has happened lately with RH Merrill Etrade if you enter the trade before the market opens with a limit you can live with then thats a hard intent If the order doesnt fill you can argue that the platform didnt allow you to update your order during market conditions Tendies secured
No but when a rich person gets the right lawyer theyll reach settlements to avoid reimbursing hypothetical situations
What kind of garbage grammar is this
Anyone use schwab
I mean to be fair the first thing I did when I couldn’t use ToS this morning was log into my TD account where I was free to trade normally just without the platform tools Logging into the source of your account is the first thing you should do when there are problems
1 If you have an actual trade the will look at itThey said they wont look at hypotheticalsYou cant say oh I wouldve bought the dip this morning if I couldve if you never tried 2 Even when I had trouble with ToS this morning I was able to access my account perfectly fine on TDAs website so I was never really locked outComparisons to RH are laughable
just use robinhood like everyone else
Already transferring funds back and into tastyworks
Well no shit
IBKR FTW
Sounds reasonable you place a trade that went not in your favor you could claim it was an issue with the system and not your brain like it probably was
Why does no one use Interactive brokers besides me What am I missing
Hate this shit HTZ 250p 717 Bought at a strike price of 135 Friday Shit tanks over 30 and it’s now worth 138 I’m getting the fuck out of this game
What happened I didnt try placing anything today Also with tda they have 3 platformsUsually one will work
RH atleast gave 75
what yall get for NOT using robinhoodsmh my head
I lost 14k because of them freezing 2 weeks ago and 7k today All hypothetical tho cuz the order on the first didnt go thru and this time I couldnt even log in
Ask your momMaybe she can help
If the guy was remotely serious he would call or email after they offeredThis is stupid outrage
They fucked me on a trade that actually executedI now use them for market data and send 99 of my order flow elsewhereIt didnt even cost me a lotBut the fact that they reversed a trade that they executed and refused to accept responsibility means they lost my businessIve been for the most part just closing positions and taking my money out since
Thats weird they reimbursed me for fucking me over this morningQuite actuallyIt was only 225 tho
Ive been day trading TSLA using TOS which as you may know is a little volatile I opened a Put position for 1050 and attempted sale at 1250 which should have filled easy based on my experience The sale took 23 minutes to submit by which time the stock reversed Tried to cancel and sell at 1075 then 10301000950market ordernothing worked None of the earlier sell orders would even cancelEventually everything caught up orders cancelled and the market order filled at 740 Called TDA held for an hour they said the time stamps indicate it should have filled at 940 instead and they refunded me the difference In reality if the system would have sent my first order when I submitted it I would have made a little profit but its just my word against the softwares time stamps TLDR calling TDA helped me a little but not a lot
Nice AMTD call then
Is their social media guy incapable of English
Why the hell aren’t you using tastyworks
Your best bet is to have multiple brokers Most will be scandalous with all this noob money coming in Webull my dude
Every broker is bullshit
People’s fault for flooding platforms
Look at all these poors whining about losing hundredsI could only tell you my account balance to the nearest 100k Imagine crying on Twitter over losing 200 bucks

Take the cash and start a software company that makes an app that does something that already exists but give it a sexy name and add some emojis Itll be worth 10B in two yearsThats my plan anyways
If feel it too you should take a look at Japanese European or even US Value stocks The main American indices are crazy but if you look elsewhere youll see single digit PEs high dividend yields
Let’s be honest this is basically a casino not the stock market
This is not an airport no need to announce your departure
48 hours ago this kid was bragging about his puts LOL
Thank you uMortalDionysus very cool
Show us on the doll where Pappa Powell touched you
Oh you will be backUS dollars is a position You are 100 invested in a guaranteed losing asset At least buy that house rentals or some land
You could sort of make a case for SPY going up since its heavily megacap tech and other giant cos that will strangle SMBsTheres an even better case for EM and DM equities that are about 45 cheaper on PE 10 basis than US stocks even factoring in sector differencesGold and miners look decent tooNo idea why the Russell has this insane moron strength when 40 were cash flow negative before the recession even hit but I got burned on that play alreadyPeople just look at the 52 week high and if its down a lot thats literally all the DD they do and theres enough of them to push it up at least till puts expire
People forget that we can learn from our past The 08 crash is the reason why the current recessions is like it is The feds enacted immediate fiscal aid and very aggressively Combo that with the ability for anyone to purchase stocks now robinhood means more greedy people with little understanding of how a true market works It truly is a stocks only go up market Ride the wave and cash out when youre happy No point in crying about it in WSB where your post is probably gonna be removed from votesx200Bedit it did not get removed by votes
I held cash in my bank savings account throughout the entire 2010s so far I dont make a lot of money at my shitty job and I was holding it expecting to go to more schooling but I was too dumb so I ended up with 120000 USD in my bank I was gonna dump 100000 into some sort of index fund or something when the market crashes late March but said no dont do it this is going to get really bad the next 23 months dump it all in in like August when the market bottoms out Instead what happens Despite massive unemployment food bank lines longer than Depression soup lines people unable to pay rents and mortgages the government taking on trillions in debt it cant repay and massive inflation should be looming the market has somehow completely recovered to where it was before and I missed out on everything again Its not like I expected it to go to zero but I expected the market to basically be at the 1500020000 level for most of the summerI know its my fault for being cash gang but I seriously did not forsee this happening
Dude Ive been resisting FOMO for 18 years Get on my leveli never made any god damn money
JPow “I’m gonna fuck the dollar to make stocks go up forever”Op “I hate money and therefore I will get out of stocks and into cash forthwith”
Respectable All the retail investors are making quite a bit off of simply buying calls on random shit It will end badly for them The only question is how long will it run for
The experienced investors are not putting much new money into stocks If the market stays this way I imagine most will be on to other things
Wish I had your resolve Probably why I can’t stop at just a couple of beers lol and why my puts are slowly dying
Preach Dow 20k is realistic Thanks for standing up for cash gang
I feel the same way but Mr Market want to go up
Buy calls tomorrow and you’ll feel like a fuqqin genius
where will you get CAGR you wont ever retire going long on cash sorry bro
Sir this is a Wendys
I got smoked with SPY puts too bro

Use your cash setup a car company that sells electric cars Spend some on Fiver to get good futurist car designs then focus on PR and news all others dont matter IPO get the storks up to some ridiculous number before you abdicate sell off and pocket those obscene profitsAs the saying go with the flow
I read OPs post in a bitchy drag queen voice
The bear market was so short because the Fed did not want a repeat of 2008 JPows printing machine algo trading retarded retail investors with easytouse apps will probably keep this market pumping for years IMO because of a very real risk or high inflation staying in cash is riskier that investing in big tech which will almost certainly hold their value given the way they are growing
So true Can’t believe this shit Younger generation didn’t even get a chance to buy the dip
And here I thought only the bears were realists refreshing to hear a bull be so down to earthI don’t blame ya as for me I’ll take this inflated overbought shit as an opportunity Sure it’s as fucked as you say but hey if it ain’t you trading options it’s someone else I’ll be making the money your notThink of it this way what’s the difference between fake tits and real tits Sure we can get into the details but at the end of the day tits are tits and if you’re willing to pass up the fake tits there will be 10 more ready to grab em
WORD
People tend to forget that the pricing of stocks is not about absolute value it is all about relative value out of all investment opportunities
So many words just to say “I’m gay and proud” Congrats on finally coming out you closeted cumguzzler
The stonk market wants me to tell you it is very sorry to lose a valuable customer It promises to crash more and deeper in the future to better meet your expectations and make all your plays print
Its not a market anymore honestly Its a slush fund at this pointThe Fed is now using unlimited QE to buy individual corporate bonds The impact this will have on the price of these assets is impossible to overstateI was one who was saying that today would be red and I said that because all the indications showed that it would be sinking futures second outbreak concerns and a bunch of technical indicatorsIt was going as expected in the AM drop then dead cat bounce that started to complete and then boom the Fed says its literally using bonds to invest in individual companies that comprise the major indexes With this it is going to be physically impossible for SPY to drop below 300 again until this is over Hilariously I now really only think that the play is to ride it up to SPY 500 and the release of a vaccinelift of all stay at home orders Then just short on earnings when every single company shows how unbelievably overvalued they are
Thank you for this I was literally feeling a bit schizo
I feel like people should start building their own companies Fuck investing into the corrupt market Make your own tendies Microbrew buy a rental property whatever youre good at
Join the gold gang
But it is the same thing as the last down turn The only reason stocks recovered with out a tremendous amount of more pain was because of the FED This is the same thing just on a hyper timeline because the story played out last time already The difference is there was a liquidity crisis last time and the fed was exactly what was needed and Geitner steered the ship well This time we just stopped having an economy for a bit so they are using the printer as a band aid because that’s all they have Things will eventually recover but now there is trillions more in the mix I failed to capture the wave up and was short for far too long but this actually kinda makes sense We’ll have some wild swings for a few months but I don’t see SPY 220 again We just aren’t going to go up at the same rate as we have been
Amen
Mad respect I wish you luck on future endeavors
Alright but what if stay with me here what if you took all that shit and put it aside and bought calls tomorrow and made money wouldnt that be nice
This bubble will blow sooner than your think lot of shit can go south until 2021
Basically speaking this is why I dont invest anything in techI work in tech and youd think the internal decay would affect the stock priceWhat seems to justify the growth rates is that tech outpaces policymakers or most politicians are criminals take your pick and basically tech shoves its wouldbe internal decay onto customers and competitorsThen you have labor abuses etc etc shit like thatx200BAlso thishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvMobfYnRRpyshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvMobfYnRRpys
Longterm or forever cash gang is the only surefire 100 losing strategy Assets prices are not only a reflection of valuation but also the value of the dollar which ALWAYS goes downThe genie is out of the bottle with regards to both fiscal and monetary policy After 2008 the playbook for handling any kind of crisis was written The Federal government is going to throw out massive bailouts and the Federal Reserve is going to tank interest rates and buy assets At the rate we are going in 10 years time your dollars will lose 2040 of its value Looking at 2019 dollars vs 2009 based on CPI the dollar lost about 17 of its purchasing power CPI isnt a great measure of inflation experienced by individuals IMO but it gives you a sense of the magnitude of the devaluation of the dollar And what the Fed has done in the last few months in terms of the expansion of their balance sheet is basically 2008 on steroids TLDR Dont be cash gang Hold your nose buy stocks Hedge with covered calls and inverse ETFs
For your level of risk tolerance you should head on over to rpersonalfinance
Cash gang after fridayI sold puts long ago that are now deep otmId just close them but im stuck between too lazy and too greedy
See you tomorrow
JPOW is going take away all your tendie buying power with his printing
What are you Buffet
Sir this is a casino
You are the modern equivalent of people who stick money under their mattress instead of in the bank and feel smart when they dodge the first bank run but real dumb when inflation hits 20 annually and you arent earning interestIm not sure what point Im trying to make here
Cash gang here Fuck this market
The market is literally bullshit
If the bubble goes on the rest of your life it ain’t no bubble mang Agree in principle though market is fucked and has no basis in reality
Cash gang till stocks crash 1k tesla is lol
Cash is king
Dont let the door hit your ass on the way out
“I got greedy and wanted cheaper pricesNow I’m watching everyone else get rich while I hold depreciating cash”
Wait so you waited 12 years and then didn’t buy in when we dipped 30 What were you waiting for Bro you had your chance you just missed it
Bro just sell puts they always expire worthless thanks to JPOW and you get nice interest on your cash
I felt the same way so to stick it to the man i bought 1 share of AAPL
Look into goldIt responds bullishly to the FedIt goes up when the SP drops Takes time thoughIf we really are headed into hyper inflation hell Gold will also hyper inflateIts just a rock It does nothing Which is bad in a risk on environment but is perfect for now Rocks dont close down during lockdowns rocks dont go bankrupt
Buy some gold and silver
YupIm cash gang till I fucking die if that was itTrumps presidency ends in a few months most likelyWorst case scenario thats the end of itId rather fucking die than go long right now and have the rug pulledFuck you marketFuck you rugYou’re not getting my money just fuck right off and die already
dude the market was down like 30where were u
If you refuse to enter a market that is going to go up youre retarded and not a traderJoin with safe and low positions or simply buy SPY calls and stay in cash laterTrend is your friend always It will go up until it starts to go down and once it goes down you want to buy puts anywayYou want to wait 15 years because your ego was wrong Fuck it dip your toes
Honestly the same started lurking here and it seems fun but no way Im getting into this shitbecause I have no liquidity lol but honestly when this shit bursts people will be looking each other with those dumb eyes wondering how it happened
What about buying stocks and setting an stop loss Even if the market only goes up in the short run you can set your stops to save some gains or minimize your losses That’s how I do it and also have some extra cash to go short if stocks dump again
Im with you going to ride this bull for about another month then going cash gang in anticipation of a crash Q1 or Q2 as corona reemerges as a result of school going back There will be more lockdowns without a prevalent vaccine I guarantee it
1000000 with you
How much did you lose today
Ban
I’ve lost so much money being a beartard waiting for bad news Nowadays I just buy more when the dips happen and I mostly double what I put in

Just buy puts with a loooooooooooong time till expiry and hedge with short term calls
Join the Kang Gang
Me too Until the next tanking
Switch to Forex my dude what goes up must come down
Yeah if the market crashes like the Soviet Union youd buy into a nonexistent market with USD that is worth less than actual toilet paperDo bears even understand what they are asking anymore If this goes full Soviet there wont be a stock market to invest in anymoreStellar DD you trade in bitconnect after the crash too
It’s going to be hard to get back in when we get news of a vaccine with unlimited QE
Sounds like some shit an old man would say
Gaaaaaaayyyyyyyy
I still made a killingthen why are you still here Time to retire my man enjoy the rest of your days
Your loss
Have you noticed that companies revenues grow fucking faster than hell now vs thirty twenty years agoGlobal access means more money to be madeThis is only the top for now in twenty years we will be spy 2000 n today will be a blip in the map
I’m in the same position as you At what levels do you think you’ll start to buy back in
tHe StOcK mArKeT iS tOo HiGh1Meme stocks are sure but you can buy plenty of other equities that are solid well run and actually have earnings and growth potential to justify their current valuationsJust to name a few FB BA DIS SPOT GILD AMZN PEP ISRG STZ EA CVX XOM BRKB and many morePlus plenty of REITs and investment trusts and mutual fundsBeing in cash is completely idiotic for the long termIf you buy in today you might be down a year from now but you 99 wont be 5 years from nowTLDR there are more than two options meme stocks cash
below 300 was a perfect time for cash gang
Think you just became warren buffet based on the strategy
No position is a position
100 agree I have seen more 100 point swings in the last couple weeks than all pre covid It is absolutely insane how much things can turn against either position The markets are inherently bullish but this is total insanity The only thing I have been doing is eyeing a handful of tech stocks and buying calls when they drop to a price pointIf I see a massive drop then it’s almost a sure call daytrade but the market is so complete nonsense once we hit 315 still way overvalued I’m going back to cash until the next correctiondump whatever we call it before jumping 100 points
I agree with you emotionallyMy first big loss was the dotcom crashBut this is differentThis time we are inflating our way out like the stories of the WW2 debtThis time its just dumb not to protect yourself from inflationStocks are protection from inflationThe market is broken and should crashOur politics are broken and will inflate past the crash Hurts us both
If you own a business that losses money and someone is willing to pay you crazy money for it what would you do Unless you know it will make enough profit in the future you would sell
You’ll enter into an overpriced derivative fomo trade by EOD Wednesday
Got it good DD ALL IN SPY 400 Calls 622
You’re too smart for this sub
Lol you are such a huge faggot Get out of here
Yo fellow autist The market is all noise but over time the price will revert to the real valueThe clowns at the fed are destroying the valueof cash begging you to invest in stocksIf you dont want to play their game get out of cash assets because these mother fuckers control the value of cashIn 2008 qe kicked in and they set the inflation rate at like 2 But just look at what happened to hard asset prices over the following 10 years house prices around the world shot up like crazyGld call 200 19032021
Why not buy small value equities which are far off their all time high
this dude got puts
Good luck trying to beat inflation At least bit bonds litta baby girrr
Sir this is a McDonalds drive thru may I take your order
Lmao You’re losing so much money through inflation Invest Stonk only go up Why do to yourself This
Inverse WSB
LOL
Im exactly the sameexcept tanker gang
Im cash gang too mostly PFE gonna make the vaccine and print for meIm thinking inflation wouldnt happen Inflation happens when demand exceeds supply for regular goods The only thing that is inflated right now is the marketThe stonk market and regular goodsservices markets have the same demand for capital We invest in the stock market for returns on capital and regular goodsservices for current consumptionIm thinking most of retail is saving up cash to pump stonks now and wont buy goodsservices The more the fed pumps the more stonks bubble the more investors will save and throw it into the stonk market rather than spend for current consumption And my god its so god damn volatile and uncertain right now cash gang seems like the only safe bet nowtddr Stonks only go up but companies only go down The Great Deflation ftw
Ok bye
Youd think someone whos so smart they made bank during the last recession would have realized a thing or two about the irrationality of the market Cash gang is pussy gang 90 of mom and pop investors will achieve higher returns by simply dollar cost averaging then you will due to being stubborn and failing to admit you dont know shit
I think its really admirable that you are able to control FOMO and are stepping out For a while I had sold out as well but of course the FOMO got the best of me and I stepped back in Ultimately what I personally fear is that our personal capacity to endure risk may be coloring our perceptions of how to respond the current situation For those who are rabid risk takers they will buy in full heartedly cite the futility of fighting the fed and rejoice on their gains These folks are more likely to ride uptrends rather than dipping out and will make great gains at least for now However they are at great risk of being completely exposed if your predictions come to pass and this market proves to be a bubble Conversely there is great risk in your risk aversion as well in that you may risk holding back on getting back in and missing a recovery I think you and I understand the situation in the same way but I fear that how we may respond to it may ultimately prove to be maladaptive at the wrong times

Its your patriotic duty to keep this bubble up til the boomers are all dead
Just buy long calls then
To be honest I still dont understand how the consumer is supposed to gain more trust and spend more in this economy Fine companies now have more debt but survived how does that translate to the average joe
You can be right or you can make money
Be gold gang Turtle for the win
When the autists are scared of the bubble It boutta pop 45 months tops 3 months bottom
This guy reminds me of those gamers who are going to quit their vidya
Fuckjng boomer
Imagine putting your morals over money LMAO
Its a win win Pay to play game Stinks cant go down if the fed will just pull out the big guns every time it dips You cant lose as a company Hertz is testimony to that Bears are dead and buried Cant fight trillions Just cant
Someone give this man a little golden star sticker
I can only take the announcement yesterdayhttpswwwcnbccom20200615thefedsaysitisgoingtostartbuyingindividualcorporatebondshtml as a receipt of me acting sane This was not bending the rules or pushing the limits This was changing the entire structure of the game I can only feel that I acted at least somewhat correctly upon the information know by the public
I don’t get all this casinooverpriced complaint Yes unprofitable tech companies are a bit overpriced but this is due to their ability to aquire cash literally anywhere so companies like uber and Tesla can keep making a loss till they go profitable this wasn’t possible with high interest rates but is possible now so they are fairly priced at high valuation for the long term Travel is cheap af and I’ve found some bargains KO is 20 down from January THINK ABOUT THAT The most long term successful company in the world is on discount by 20 and sales will be fine in 12 months This is the mindset of most investors TLDR I’ll sell you puts if you want to get involved in the market
So what puts should I buy
Youll be back next week
STOXX 600 is trading at roughly a PE of 156 thats not overboughtJust move market if you think one market is inflated Theres always a great deal out there
Well SPX will do a final push to 5000 before the epic dump so you’re gonna lose out plenty on inflation bro Your loss
Stopped reading at things went amazing for me in 2008 god damn boomer
i love my ego more than money
Loser
What movie is this
But I force a smile knowing that my retardation far exceeded my autism
Sounds bullish
Thats alot of words just to say you’re gay
can we get these europoors outta my feed pls
Solution make piles of money now so it won’t be an issue later
We are risking deflation trap rn fam id be happy w some inflationdollar has been appreciating the fed is actively trying to create inflation to fight the deflation
InflationWhat’s that Technological innovation has created huge deflationary pressures
Well you do realize losing money on the marke AND inflation picking up is also an option right Thats like double the loss
Lol that you think this Fed will let inflation rise higher than the elites deem fit which isn’t high They’ll raise rates to the moon if it spikes which appears likely

I dont think cash gang understands much of anything
If inflation picks up the printers get turned off immediately
Dont put this on your grinder profile
money gang jesus christ
People whove been buying puts have been getting their assholes raped so far
Youre not wrong But if you try to short them right now youll get a big green dick Cause marketsSeriously everyone of the heavy hitters is stepping up their game for video chat and should be able to make Zoom a friendster or myspace Thing is it hasnt happened yet
Thanks for stating the very obvious for the 2839893987th time
Yeah Im never buying a put ever again
Definitely overvalued But don’t short a fine company on overvaluation I was taught that lesson many times
Fundamentals dont work for past three months Its all about sentiment Just wait for Q2 earning reports across all tech companies Once we see QQQ bleed zoom will followBesides why are you asking this on wsb Go to rinvesting
The trend is your friend Logic says it’s a bubble but you are more likely than not to get ass raped if you try to time the pop
Their PE is half what it was in the days following their IPO and their valuation much higher If they’re overvalued they’re getting less overvalued not more
Oh look its this thread again
Software guy here too and I shorted them today I totally agree with you that their product is not difficult to replicate in fact it is replicated already MS teams Google Meet and FB Messenger just need to copy a few more of the nicer touches in Zoom for it to be complete On top of that they seem to be totally complicit with the Chinese government and I dont know how theyve gotten as high as they haveI dunno when theyll fall so Jan 21 180p
yah i pulled out cause i dont want to hold shares in a company that will pop at any second
Jul 17 220P Amen
I want to buy puts I really do but this has retard strength and puts are super expensive on premiums right now so Im gonna sit this one out and then regret it once it does drop hard
Weedstocks 20 Workfrom home editionIMO
I have some 717 200P on them so I definitely agree on the overvaluation But it’s really not going to start dipping until people start going back to work everywhere which might not be by 717 My options are down about 20 since I bought but if you can ride the wave we all know it’s going down eventually
That shut going down to 50 beyond meat 20
Constant puts constant short squeezeBtw everything is overvalued if the debt of the past years cannot be paid back
Wow is Zoom’s PE ratio actually that high
I’m at a big institution 30000 undergraduates and a lot of graduates and we are still using Zoom this fall I’d still bet on Zoom being fine until end of 2020 or early 2021 depending on the university trendsAnd I’ll add that Zoom is leaps and bounds over Teams or any other platform AS OF NOW Zoom is like La Croix to me They did something new and great but the product is easily replicable and won’t be on top much longer As a prof Zoom has really interesting features that makes instructing smoother
Zoom had one of the best quarters in technology history in Q1 and Q2 will be a monster beat for them as well Like Salesforce Docusign Facebook etc its platform wouldn’t be all that hard to copy but when you become a de facto solution for a particular piece of software it’s hard to disruptSoftware is more vulnerable to competition than other industries in tech I tend to lean more towards infrastructure in my investing microchips cloud etcbut I do own a smattering of software across my portfolio and making good money owning ZoomLong term it could be vulnerable to competition but short term no reason not to ride the uptrend
When I saw zm go up to 160 I was thinking of buying puts Easy money rightThankfully I didnt
Just because I think a company is overvalued doesnt mean I think its going down Im staying away from anything with hype Shorting anything listed on robinhood most popular is one lesson Ive learned from getting shocked so many times
We have this epidemic break out There is a lot interest with free account running video conferences Most of the coding software development is done overseas at fraction of the US cost Fundamentals of having a low cost structure still does not justify the stellar stock price A Tian An Men Square Memorial ServiceUS based account was broken into by Chinese cyber cops The interest can change if Google product becomes more popularAt least no one is listening from Google conference
Zoom will use will go down over time So when schools arent using zoom the bubble will popI dont see zoom transitioning to be the new normal
That’s the most retarded thing you could do The year is 1999 and nobody gives two shits about valuation metrics Once a stock is untethered from old school nonsense such as valuation the sky is the limit and there’s no reason it won’t be trading at 150 billion valuation just as well
Zm is being pumped by China
Logic tells me the same but all I see is my puts on ZM going to 0
As a software engineer you should shut the fuck up thinking you know shit about finance or valuation software engineer The market doesn’t run on logic
You are 100 correct Stay away from zoom If you insist on buying puts do it the day we get a vaccine
I say buy the dip
Tech in general is considered a safe haven from the volatility of pretty much everything else and Zoom while less of a meme fills the same position as Tesla in the minds of traders Short at your own fucking peril
I haven’t looked into zoom much yet but keep in mind that valuations are based on forward growth potential Zoom is one of the most well known enterprise and consumer video communication solutions in the world As we return to a new “normal” companies big and small universities and individuals will be looking for a video communication solution The valuation is based on growth A reason to short would be if you thought this growth can’t be realized Knowing that there is a market for this product for the growth to not be realized is if there was a better mouse trap out there as you allude to Well there isn’t one yet that’s better that’s well known TEAMS comes closest but it doesn’t have the widespread use and most IT peeps will tell you ZOOM is the better product Hence callsI’m interested in being told I’m wrong and rethinking my position at all times Please feel free to argue
Have you seen W A company that isnt profitable has never been profitable and has no clear path to profitabilityTheir losses go up every quarter and yet so does their stock price Stock moves up as losses increaseMakes no fucking sense
Jan 21 160 put my ass is lubed up since I bought when Zoom was 175
Same with Beyond Meat
Zoom is like piedpiper
Nothing is overvalued Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
As a biologist I would say tomatos are red
Just do yourself a favor and move alongThis is wingstop level retard strength
This sub complains about ZM being overvaluedAlso this sub TSLA 1000c
Bigger than Hertz IDK manIm waiting for them to join the FAANG gang where they definitely dont belongSeriously their moat is almost non existent especially if alphabet facebook microsoft or apple decide not to allow it and get serious about competingIm guessing they want no part of the bubble and will be there to clean up the messTheyre one or 2 scandals away from a massive sell offThe one thing theyve got is a respectable user base and well known name Can they parlay that Well see
No shitThe only problem is that betting against it means betting against every boomer who is pumping it right now
Overvalued Yes Does playing the market in a logical manner work No
You mean theres an upper limit on a free video conferencing service used to stream child porn
Society fully opens and ZMs valuation will shrink rapidly A short while ago any vaccine news did just that Its not being tethered by much
Software guy here too And I bought calls because stocks only go up
Corporate investments that go on the income statement are still investments from an economic and valuation perspective There are a lot of these with software companies The short story is that PE is irrelevant here brother The irony is that we are seeing a huge number of bubbles in the market and Zoom is not even a clearcut case of a bubble
Why are you valuing a growth company using traditional metrics used for a mature company
After a short consideration and zero additional research I just bought dgly 619 calls on margin
After 15 seconds of critical thinking I too bought a shit load
Son of a bitch I’m in

One important piece a lot of us are missing is data storage If body cam usage by PDs skyrockets across the country all that data needs to be stored somewhereand we’re talking terabytes per day Anyone know which cloud storage platforms are currently being used by the larger PDs who use these cameras
DGLY is already the highest its been in 3 years and AAXN is at ATH outperforming the marketYou guys missed the pumpMight buy puts on AAXN tomorrow if it rises on open

Calls on gopro for body cams
I was wondering why it was mooning If only you had posted this before 330 pm only 30 min before market closes
does that article even mention body cams at all
WRTC will eventually replace guns and tasers for law enforcement
He was going to talk about this shiet last week either Thursday or Friday I don’t remember which one but I do remember him not saying anything about body cams and dgly going down
Puts it is 5p 619
Even if they go bankrupt all those cars won’t just hit the market They will be picked up in bankruptcy and sold at auction to dealers
Lol I can’t believe you wrote this muchIt’s too late They’ve already been infront it a judge Ball is rolling No last minute bailouts
700000 cars worldwide is fuck all to liquidateThey will get bought by competitors and some used as government fleet vehicles and the remainder auctioned
ive made some speculative investments during this crash MGM CCL ACB DFFN HAL VTIQ etcbut hertz lol i would buy lottery tickets before buying that
Used car prices are going way up right now because of the Covid19 production shutdowns Wholesalers are paying in excess of 105 of wholesale value at used car auctions when they normally pay 95 because theyre all running out of shit to sell People in frontline car sales have never seen so many 1200 down paymentsHertzs fleet wont even make a dent in the demand for used cars and trucks in the marketplace right now Your DD is shittier than my SPY puts
You’re forgetting Hertz employs 29000 people in USA and probably contributed to hundreds of thousands of jobs in some way So it definitely is a candidate That being said fuck bailouts let them bleed and let make good balance sheets relevant again
If only logic mattered in this market
Bruh you run outta crack
Two problems 1 Fleet Auctions2 Youve never rented from Hertz before Bring it back caked in mud mud and water inside floorboards and their response no problem itll buff right out
NaAfter BK the cars would just go to the new rental company ownersalso called Hertz
New car sales are already Fuk
Because I bought into them
Can’t believe I wasted my time reading all that sheesh Puts on Toyota It is
How can Ibuy one of their used cheap cars

First line reads 535000 thousand thats how you know its a quality DD Im going all in
Or you know once the demand picks up another rental car company will fill the void and theyll need a bigger fleet
Someone doesn’t know what a chapter 11 is

BULLCOCKINCOMING
this is legit may 12th18th again Have some giant dip bears blow their load prematurely huge fucking bounce back after the dip 2 days later
Its so satisfying seeing retarded permabulls like OP and permabears lose out on tons of gains by not playing both directions
Hell yeah bro nice 40 gain yesterday fuck those bears let’s fucking go bro bull gang bull gang fuck yeah
Bears arent seeing the big picture Sure theres a pandemic and the economy is badBut there is so much debt out there that the only possible move for the Fed and other central banks is to give everyone free money until there is inflation The fed openly said that they will keep rates at zero for years Its pretty much a one sided bet You can borrow at 2 and buy safe stocks paying 5 dividendsThe reality is that all stocks are still mainly owned by boomers and there isnt as much people in the next generations to buy it all from them as they retire and die The Fed can only loan money so they will push loans to creditworthy individuals to corporations that do buybacks and they will just buy assets themselves All of this to maintain the level of the stock markets as boomers sellThe Fed is allowing you to buy your share of corporate america and pay with dollars that it is telling you will be devalued There are two possible outcomes if there is no inflation just keep the infinite QE going If there is inflation more like when there is inflation it has to happen eventually corporate profits will go up with inflation and debt is devalued
It just sucks when you had options expiring 612
So satisfying to know the stock market is 100 propped up by an infinite and worthless money supply and is completely disconnected from reality and the economy itself Such good economics
I don’t like this People lose money Don’t beat a dead horse They are already sad
Just wait The double top is forming and eventually buying the dip will cost you a lot of money
Suck to be a

Call your fav congressman and ask him to pose some well worded questions to powell today at his testimony Im sure congress needs to know what rainbow bears are and how to protect this rare species
All these bears so shocked that stonks go up like you knew the hulk dicks were coming but you just haaadd to fight the feds
How about TD Ameritrade TOS Schwab Many were not able to trade when the market was down and all of the sudden it started working like magic when the market was racing up F for TOS today
I hope you average down with some calls
I dont care where uncle pow touched you Be a good child and dont ruin Christmas for the family

Just SS this Im going to print it out and frame it pass it on generation to generation This is what will make fortunesIn all non memery thankus for this
Buy the dips Faggot Warren B
Nothing matters anymore Stocks only go up
I too try to read between the lines and right now Im wondering which major company CEO called j pow and told him they were going bankrupt if they couldnt issue more toxic debt You know they didnt just start targeted buying of bonds out of the blue some major American company is in huge trouble right now and the fed is quietly trying to bail them out using the bond market rather than a direct 2008 style bailoutBuying ETFs wasnt providing enough support to the distressed company so they had to grant themselves the ability to buy more of troubled companies directly to make sure their bonds dont fail while the rest of the junk bond ETF survivesI bet the investment bankers know exactly which company the fed is doing this for and are disappointed their profit on the collapse just got yeeted
Its crazy that this is not transparent to every market participant In order to announce good news that would mean scaling back Feds repo operations and 0 interest rates The market would shit itself if Jerome so much as used the work hike
Obligatory BRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Printing money to solve a pandemic is like pouring water on a gas leak it’s not gonna stop the explosion but it’s nice to know the fire won’t be as big after and maybe some of kitchen utensilwill survive
I was a devout catholic for my first 11 years of life but when my priest fucked me I turned to the light of Jerome Powell and his sweet sweet tendie machine DOW 50K
So when the Fed prints money it is called economic stimulusBut when I do it its called Money laundering and I go to jail
goddamn that motherfucker is still printin money we gonna owe the mf Deceptacons a bag

Imagine if it was the negative balance glitch Tfw Robinhoods shitty code killed a kid
Saw this article earlier and thought to myself that this kid might have had the short legs on some spreads get exercised Robinhood will show a negative balance for the shares used to fulfill your obligation on shorts even though your long legs have you hedged to define your risk I’ve had some weekends where it looks like I’m negative tens of thousands of dollars only to have lost a couple hundredMy heart sunk at the thought someone might have killed them selves over robinhood’s shitty over the weekend net liquidity calculation But at the same time I wouldn’t be surprised if he actually managed to owe that much to robinhood Stranger things have happened with that shitty broker RIP kid my thoughts and prayers go out to your family and friends
As nobody seems to understand a goddamn thing about options He didnt have 700k leverage and he didnt lose 700k He had a spread the short leg was assigned and the long leg hadnt yet been exercised in his account ledger His account will be back to normal by tomorrow morning with a relatively tiny loss or even gainPlease understand this Its very likely to happen to any one of us Its nothing to be alarmed about You need to understand the order of assignment to exercise and what your account balances may display while its processing
If you ever win tendies to buy a lambo might I suggest also spending a lil on a therapist Not because youre screwed up or need it but just to see what its like I went to a therapist for a couple months when things were fine for me It mostly just felt like deep campfire talks instead at 3pm Pretty interesting and I gained a perspective and empathy for those who absolutely need therapy my gf at the time It also destigmatized the whole concept for me Just an
Should have just uninstalled the app instead of his life Rip Alex
Real talk gang be careful You might not think you’re the suicidal type until you’re facing a similar abyss The call of oblivion in the face of crippling debt at such an early age is realPay attention to your accounts use margin carefully and gtfo out of the market and take a break if things start the downward spiral Just like with poker don’t gamble on tilt
Jesus Christ never even think about ending your life over money 8 years ago I was homeless and now Im a millionaire theres always ALWAYS a way out No matter how bad it gets remember banks have tons of money guns are cheap and Brazil doesnt extradite
I think poor kid probably sold AMZN TSLA or AAPL call spreads and got assigned on the short legs If you are a retard newb my free advice is dont join Kang gang or Theta gang Dont do any credit spreads period Stick with simple buying calls or puts Just limit your risk by buying less than 5 of your net liq
The best traders have lost their fortunes on more than one occasionNo amount of money is ever worth paying the ultimate priceMay you swim in tendies for eternity Rest in peace
I don’t think you can get that much leverage on robinhoodThe only thing I can think of is their glitch when spreads show ridiculous numbers after hours before both legs settle
The worst part is that he probably didnt even owe that much in the first place This is why not switching to TD Ameritrade can literally end your life
Jesus fuck How Considering the volatility of the market there are a whole lot of posters on here thats lost or going to lose a lot of money I know we all give each other shit but lets be decent toward each other Some emotional support when people are down can go a long long wayThat aside please hedge Its no fun losing everything
Selling calls and puts is how I imagine he racked up that much in debt I find it hard to believe they just lent him that Sad story
If i was 17 and saw i owed robinhood 700000id just delete the fucking app and BOOM no money owedPoor kid
I lost 13k on CFD margins and thats after i loaded up 20k cash How to get 700k loss without margin call by broker is beyond me
Clearly had spreads probably on SPY or something else high dollar and got assigned on one leg but either didnt react or couldnt react because RH OR their fucked up balance status shown overnight especially on weekends Thats why I dont fuck with spreads or RH IF TRUE I dont believe anything any media outlet puts out there
Might be an unpopular opinion but Robinhood needs to SERIOUSLY address this Not just give a generic statement giving their condolences to the family Who’s running their riskmanagement department Who allowed him even the ability to trade on margin like this Poor kid Such a sad story
Well fuck here come the brain dead media headlines calling for government to regulate this shit
Only thing I could imagine is if he opened a spread and got assignedI always close my position if the sold option is too itm and close to expiry so I’m not sure if assignment risk happens with spreads or if they’ll exercise yours to offset
This sounds like a sketch story it’s literally impossible to borrow that much without collateral
It’s like asking how that 12 year old kid managed to catch a plane to Bali on his own If we answer the question then the world loses another mystery and gets a little more boring

“All of us at Robinhood are deeply saddened to hear this terrible news and we reached out to straight up dab on the family
I knew it video games do cause violence
I feel like Robinhood was just one of the platforms in playI do agree with Mr Brewsters general sentiments though the memes and posts are entertaining but theres some real hurt behind themWeve seen the complaints about there being too many gainloss posts here and this reinforces the need for some changeI believe it would help if WSB would stop glorifying the gainloss porn in almost every new threadMaybe gainloss should just be isolated to a single weekly threadNewbies see dozens of frontpage posts about someone making a huge gain on some highrisk play or someone losing their shirt for being on the other end of that highrisk playAnd sometimes people drink their own pissWSB could easily lose half of its daily posts about gainloss porn and be better off for it
He should have spoken to someone People do know bankruptcy court exists right
I think what probably happened is the kid was trading spreads Probably alot of them and they got exercised Robinhood gets goofy when stuff is in clearing and wont show the long leg of the spread as being exercised too So it could show 700k but be even or down his premiums
Cant he just claim bankruptcy and be done with in 7 years
Ah another bankruptcy speedrunner
Enjoy option trading while it lasts because after this blows over you wont be able to trade options without having 25K in your account
One of Us
Tech Twitter loves the idea of Gen Z WSB app httpstwittercom2irl4ustatus1272282315511791616
Does file bankruptcy work in this type of deficit if legit loss
F in da chat
Robinhood doesnt care about what happened to this kid since this is how brokers make money Nothing will happen to them Sadly this is just one case of the many others who started option trading since the pandemic and have taken their lives by gambling for the first time trying to make it rich Invest for the long term and only gamble 12 of your portfolio max That is how you guarantee to get rich
Um Robinhood doesn’t collect he should have just deleted the app
No one seems to mention that Robinhood also fucking lists your options as worthless when the stock trips a breaker I saw my dgly puts go to 01 and said I was down 10000 for 5 minutes That shit is dangerous
Sounds like robinhood has a problem
Who the fuck does spreads on RH
Can someone explain how this happened so it won’t happen to me
Weve seen you own us 700000 My condolencesNow leave our god damn house and pay the outstanding 400000
more like Robbinthehood
classic if you owe 500 you have a problemIf you owe the banks 700000 they have a problem
Rest in peace kid May you swim in tendies for eternity
So sad to see The current climate will take out a lot of accounts Hope all the kids on WSB just learn and get stronger from their trading experience The younger you are the more time you have to make money
Robinhood is fucking terrible These irresponsible cunts are just handing out margin like its Halloween candy to any retard who asks for it
If Im just buying and selling calls and puts im good right Max loss is what I put in
1 why is this garbage brokerage still allowed to be open 2 why do idiots still use it
Robinhood is probably one of the worst things to ever happen to the stock market
its criminal that banks and trading platforms can post random shit in accounts that fucks with people my bank told me I had 33k more than I actually did because of a stock split this kind of thing doesnt need to happen
Is this a bad time to comment YOLO
Damn I m glad when I started trading I didnt even know about options trading When I found out what it was big short movie made sense in its entiretyIts legal gambling for all ageseven if you are a professional trader shit can go very right but also very very wrong
Everyone keeps talking about at such a young age this is no different than traders jumping out of windowsSome people do it some people dont The reasons have almost nothing to do with whether someone will since someone else wont
Theres no way the story was realYall will fall for anything
Asking for real does he actually have to pay the loss if he and his family doesnt have the money and cant possibly ever pay it back
Trading stocks IS gambling You’re just taking some of the RNG out of it if you do research or have a longterm portfolio I feel like this needs to get said more often a lot of young traders start trading because they think they can double triple their bank balance Please only trade what you’re willing to lose never borrow with the intent of trading unless completely bulletproof at the end of the day it’s a gamble
Was he selling options You don’t have the same risk when you buy calls right
If he had flipped it again to 2 mil we’d be applauding him It’s truly tragic but it was self inflicted Kid knew what margin was
The market dont care about your feelings Now wheres my 700k Alex
How do you get access to that much leverage Asking for a friend
FK RH

Holy shit HOLY SHIT HoLy ShIt
Is this even legal If it is rh wont see any of the money
oh shit was this the 20 year old cousin of the dude that posted here or in roptions yesterday I conmented I mean how much can a 20 year old even invest but goddamn RH needs to get their shit together
Wait this just sounds like one of his legs got assigned Did this kid kill himself for nothing I cant imagine how you get so much margin and end up 700k in debt I mean either way this is sad all around
deleted
Wouldnt be surprised if this was just robinhoods bad ux and nothing else App design matters people
If you owe Robinhood 700000 you dont have a problem Robinhood has a problem
Well at least the weekend spread assignment balance bug is finally going to get fixed RIP
Dow futures is down 900 points Wonder how many more are going to deal with the losses
There is still an Infinite leverage glitch that has not been patched Im not going to tell you how it is done because I am currently using it
Idk maybe he had naked short options and in went against him like a face ripper or maybe he got assigned and was bagolding the position and then it went against him
Lol first time I used tastyworks I bought some options and next day it bugged and showed 40k and it scared the fuck out of me
I read this when it was posted on rRobinhoodand no one on that subreddit understands how the fuck options work Why the fuck would he unlock level 3 options trading without knowing what the fuck he was doing I started trading 5 Months ago and didn’t even touch level 3 shit let alone writing calls and puts until I learned more about options
This
How was this even possible
Robinhood is probably going to add a quiz or something to make sure people understand some of what they’re doing before something like this happens again
It actually sucks to think that if that kid stayed on just 12 more days the glitch would’ve corrected himself and all would’ve been well
You guys are going to lose your ability to trade options it is the CFD ban all over again
RIP we gotta do better as a community this is horrible Condolences to his family as wellx200BSide note RH is as corrupt as it gets for brokerages
Sold options twice bought to close as soon as both ended up itm learned my lesson
But he’s a teenager means he has nothing or do his parents own the debt Because if they don’t then RH can come after his nothing
I demand one robinhood “executive” to be executed as retribution
Wait You literally cant even have an account unless youre 18 Robinhood probably shouldnt of given him reimbursement if he broke the TOS just from a business standpoint
Not CTNHe is 2526 yo while Alex was 20
I think it might be time to see if I can regain access to my defunct TD Ameritrade account and start moving
are we believing this my first reaction was that it was a troll
heavy regulations here we come trigger happy white people for the win
Their software is a disaster and their risk management is worse
After hearing this and several bad comments about Robinhood I refuse to use it
Holy shit thats absolutely awful Honestly the entire RH management team needs a fucking slap They are not taking the responsibility of hosting peoples money seriously enough Glitches and problems the entire time
Sounds like a true autist His name was Robert Paulsen
guh
Was this the guh kid Rip
Watch it be an error because of a wide bidask and he offed himself over fake numbers
All he needed to do was uninstalled the app Poor kid didnt have to do the rope
Though Alex probably wasnt actually down 700K RH could GAF less about anyone but RH To think otherwise is just being naive
Maybe this should draw attention to the credit system spending some types of credit should really be encouraged The system probably does not account for swings between deflationary and inflationary marketsThe allcreditspendingisbad model needs some work Yoloing 700k in robinhood isnt the same as renovating and flipping an old house i mean call me autistic The housing market could become deflationary and demorebuild could be the real winner The point im trying to make is that the credit system was built by boomers and may just be a broken vending machine that always takes your quartersEdit condolences to the family this young man actually took his life over this
So in the land of the Murica you cannot get a beer until youre 21 but you can be liable for a lifelong worth of debt
So can you get assigned without RH Gold I read the ToS and I didnt find anything saying you can be assigned unless you use Gold
This reminds me of chris saccas story when he used leverage and ended up with 4M in debt took him 57 years to pay it all off but when he talked about his story he said it in such a light hearted way Always was confused about how somebody could be 4 millions in debt but still manage to stay positive Really shows you how mentality is everything Rip to this kid wish he decided to stick around and take this horse on
Congress to outlaws puts because normal people cant be expected to know what they re doing
Wait can someone please explain to me how this happened Im a novice and I want to avoid this mistake
Why didn’t he just delete the app
Its like bankruptcy doesnt exist
Is this real Cant tell if its just friend of a friend BS
Naturally marketwatch found about it from WSB as it was discussed this past weekend I find it hard to believe they organically discovered it as they’ve lifted tons of article topics from wsb in the past
This is really sad If its true that its because of Robinhoods shitty weekend liquitidy calculation then it makes it even worseWe probably will never know as RH will never disclose and the account will probably not be accessible anymoreI dont see how he could have run up that much debt without openingselling spreads and getting assigned
Lol why would u touch options bordering 1000 ivThere can be retards on both sides
Motherfucker when will you learn
Hypothetical for you guysElon Musk gets hired as CEO of Hertz How much does this rally 10x in a weekIn this day and age CEOs are influencers and stonk prices gets pumped because people believe in their vision even if financials say otherwise
I’m also regretting listening to the bearshitholes They’ve tricked me
“Lol look at all these retards buying Hertz I’m gonna buy some Hertz”
Can you imagine a world without the federal reserve propping everything up The United States would lose a lot more than money we would lose our global influence if we were taking out by a heavy case of the flu
My thinking on Hertz which I hope is common of most RH traders is that throwing a bit of play money at Hertz wasnt going to sting too much if the stock becomes utterly worthless But if it rebounds even a modest gain will make me feel good Just that little bit of dopamine like chasing points in fantasy football So I look at this situation solely in the light of how much I could lose and expecting that to happen rather than how much I might gain Losing like 500 isnt the end of the world But if something wild happens during the week like Elon blurting out that Hertz would be great to acquire to start rolling out more vehicles with autopilot capability to renters then my god HTZ will rebound like a kangaroo on a trampolineShit someone could go tweet that at him and he might agree its a good idea which would be all it takes in this market
It might go down but your options wont do anything
It’s because researching a 3 letter ticker is hard compared to looking at a squiggle and listening to the sweet nothings Robinhood whispers into your ear via the newsbars
When Your mailman or Gf gives you stock tipstime to pull out In the bed room too
It would seem retards have Hertz strength
Instead of buying puts either sell naked calls or a call credit spread
Does her Husband know shes about to lose all her money
Lol why would you have a girfriend when you are clearly
Hertz is so hot right now
Who gives a fuck they are being manipulated by 10 pre market everyday and have wild swings Even with crazy debt and being on verge of bankruptcy you will never know because this idiotic market has decoupled from fundamentals so they’ll be flying high and then file bankruptcy while you’re holding the bag
Short term callsLong term putsedit I meant long term moar calls

Calls for oct
I cannot even explain how much it hurt to open up robinhood today to see HEAR over 15 when I sold my 32 717 15c for 15 last Friday and then proceeded to blow up my account and lose all 4k over the weekend as I fell for the bear trap Today is a painful day
lmao did a boomer write this article
Think of how much CALPERs and CALSTRS are invested into PCG the state has an interest in raising PCG
This ticker is heavily manipulated btw But I’m ready for the rocket ship
Judge Mental sounds like its a lucky ticket for WSB Im in
How do we know that its likely to have a final decision tomorrow This play hinges entirely on whether or not a decision is made before Friday
I was with you till the end where you suggested lottos on it Think this one deserves LEAPs but what do I know Im bag holding some 20c 918 that are down 70
I think you covered it tomorrow is final last gasp objections imo before the confirmation order is signed and montali gives the objectors the bootHes been patient but hes at his wits end based on how hearings and docket filings have been going He wants this over with and thinks so far everythings been fair and gucci for folks
Least risky play IMO is to just go fullboomer and get stock below 1100
Ive been holding 626 14C for a minute now I am heavily down so I hope you are correct sir
I did my own DD on this one and decided to buy a few calls further out at 918 I wasnt afraid of the exit being cancelled but I read up on some of the protest vote motivations and they seem more deadset on just delaying things as revenge rather than trying to look out for themselves and move forward It seems like the judge wants to be respectful to the victims so I expect these delays to push closer to the deadline of the 30th where the judge can do the final signing and the victims know theres no time left to debateWell see how it all goes In addition to the 918 15c I picked up I bought shares of the stock directly and will keep an eye on things for an opportunity to unload and get into a company I like Theres a good chance I just sit on the shares for a couple years since Im long term and If the price crosses well past my strike in Sept I might actually exercise and hold If the bear market comes PCG being a utility might actually be a decent position to haveLastly and take this with a grain of salt I found some info somewhere that seems to have been deleted now in a news article that mentioned 2 phases of the share offering thats being used to raise capital The first internalprivate sale had a price of 1050share and the second public sale was at 1265 Almost all of the shares have already been allocated under contract I really dont expect there to be a huge stock dump at the end of the 90 day maturation period since PCGs recovery could be very strong if they can get their shit together while the wildfire fund and more stringent oversight serve as a good backstop for potential future problems
Those 6 13c are very tempting
I’m in 15c 717
What time is hearing at
So here is judges schedule httpswwwcanbuscourtsgovjudgemontalicalendarIt shows PCG tomorrow and post confirmation shit on the 0617To me this means confirmation happens tomorrow I like eow 12c sept 17c and jan 21 40c
Double check the info but I do recall seeing an article that mentioned the shares issued to the victim fund will be subject to a 90 day lock up httpswwwbenzingacomanalystratingsanalystcolor200616254402thisanalystisbullishonpgefollowingstockdealwithwildfirevictimsCould also have interpreted that wrong but I believe it to be the case
626 15all the way to the moon and if not a captain sinks with his ship
Tldr Just buy shares
Got my calls and shares ready to moon been sitting on this since I evacuated my home near Santa Rosa late last year from the Kincade Fire The rebound is imminent
PCG niggas for like the fifth time this year httpsiimgurcomfHaUd8tjpgHopefully this week is actually it lmaooo
lottos tickets might not be worth it Take longer term positions instead Im sure the judge approval and dilution is priced in so I dont expect huge movement Also OP forgot to list wild fire risk
I jumped in on Thursday and have been averaging down the last 2 days Will probably load up more since it looks like an EOd dump
I have no idea what this will do tmw after the announcement Instant pop up to 13 15 Pop to 115 and slow crawl to 13 by Friday Stay dead fucking flatWould be a lot easier to plan my exit
Today’s the day Take us to tendie town judge
I have a extremely risk averse 9C 918 basically Im very skeptical of a big jump short term because of how volatile markets are but even a slight upside is fine
The number of people on WSB following this play makes me nervous
This post was flaired as DD so its on the DD list Find more fresh WSB DD herehttpsnsredditcomrwallstreetbetssearchsortnewqflair3ADDrestrictsrontdaHey uScienceDaveRE dont misuse DD flair No shitposts short and vague guesses links as DD etc DD is for walloftext deepdive Pepe Silvia shit Please change the flair if this isnt DD Mods have been notified of this threadSubmission Flair GuidehttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetswikilinkflairI am a bot and this action was performed automatically Please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecomposetorwallstreetbets if you have any questions or concerns
918s past 15 have been dummy cheap and their volatility has spiked a few times over the past few weeks at one point jumping from 038 to 520 for a few seconds Hopefully their equity deal and exposure to the market makes it blast off since most estimates I see value PGE between 1517 with BofA giving a conservative 14
got some 724 15c and 918 12c cant wait
remindme 12 hours

Since this sub is always wrong can people stop posting about pcg mooning
Not just Fed ACTIONS a lot of it is just jawboning When markets tank the Fed or the Treasury or economic advisors Kudlow invariably make an appearance in the financial press to assure investorsIt’s like fighting gravity the most powerful forces in monetary and fiscal policy have openly shown they will do whatever it takes So why bother trying to fight against their efforts when they have infinite resources
Lost 3k on puts today so yeah fk all this DD bs
We full Japan now
US Stock Market FEDThe economy is fucked and the FED cant seem to lend efficiently to main street especially to small businesses that god manhandled by Rona

Technical analysis wouldve done you some good today We bounced directly off VWAP 3 times in the first 20 mins of trading Obviously bullish after that
Cant believe how much the bears bitch about it instead of just sitting back making free monies
That’s not true Technicals were setting up for a rally on ES and NQ futures I played the intraday short on Friday covered it as we hit 300 on SPY bought stonks at close as I saw bullish divergences on futuresToday surprise motherfucker strong bounce after the screeching 3 down on futures overnight and people voting for limit down on WSB Unloaded puts that I had from before first thing in the morning and bought stonks again Wrote calls at resistance at market closeFully expect a bounce to 312 if it comes where I will write more callsFully technical no fucking fundamental noise you fucks listening to cnbc and trading of I don’t even know what’s going on in the world Futures are my news Only by going full autist and isolating from the noise can you achieve the singularity with the stonks and become like one fucking functioning organism
I feel like we’re just being toyed with I’m 98 cash Day trades only until a crash or things start making sense I have no idea which way is up
This is really bad literally now the stock market will be pumpd by the fed smart people will move their assets offshore or to metals That will make the US dollar less valuable increasing the price of imported goods and making american products cheaper on the international levelAnd because the dollar will continue to lose value the oil producer countries can pledge the price of oil to another currency and America can either declare war or let the dollar continue to fallEverything will be green tomorrow but it is a fucking joke now
I dont get why so many people think that TA is Bullshit Banks use TA to pump the markets and news are released at certain levels Yesterday there was a big buy signalhttpswwwtradingviewcomxFSUI9kA5Bigger picture 1 stochastic bullish cross2 fake out trend line3 support at 50 dmahttpswwwtradingviewcomx9peAaqBV
I was over in Tokyo Japan last year and every shop was rented and packed with lines of people waiting to buy consumer goods One of the most cleanest friendliest respectful and futuristic cities I have been to compared to allot of the shit holes in the west Might not be great for stocks but low interest rates have been fantastic for their economy jobs and citizens They just have to work out how to get their people having more babies as the pop growth is negative
what are the fed bets then idot
Or you can just physically buy the shares
US Economy Fed brrrr brrrr brrrr
Technical analysis is stupid Fundamental analysis usually proves correct We’re generally down 10 from the start of the year with some bubbles and some more significant discounts This is fair considering Q1 wasn’t AWFUL That being said an issue with FA is that it’s backward looking and requires forward guidance for accurate estimates and that just isn’t in placeThe Fed can do whatever they want but if they really could fix everything we’d be at Dow 30k not 15 from the highs A bad Q2 could easily push us down another 510 especially if guidance is worse than expectedIt won’t be enough to make spy 200 put holders wealthy but it would be enough to potentially drag us back to 2223kOvertime though stocks always go up on the whole If this is news then you shouldn’t be trading or investing
This post is trash too so congrats on tying it all together
